# Short description
A short description about the tech hub. ~300 words. Probably at least 100. But not more than 1000

# Basic history
A brief history of the tech hub. When it was founded. Included any major changes to focus area or legal structure. It would be nice to includ changes to leadership. ~300 words

# Covid Response
Did the hub close at all? Were any member directly affected? Did activities go remote or were they suspended? Current outlook for managing the pandemic?

# Response to growing remote environment
How much of the hubs activities are conducted online? Are they pivoting to more remote focused activies? Or is the hub focusing on activities that can't be as easily done online. Are members finding similar resources online now instead?
