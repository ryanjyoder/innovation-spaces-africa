blurb: We are a student found and run lab operating on campus at AUC. Our goal is to engage the AUC (American University in Cairo) community in the global maker movement.
description: 'We strive to provide a working space for AUCians with all they need to imagine and create. We currently have a 3D printer, Laser cutter, and a precision milling CNC; along with common tools, electronic components and Arduinos. We have been open for one semester during which members of our team are available during the day to help with the machines and designs. Students from all departments regularly visit ed Fab Lab AUC to prototype and finish projects; sometimes they do projects required in their courses. We plan to expand in the next semester: get a vinyl cutter, get more working space, enroll in fab academy, offer scheduled workshops, and automate some of the operations. '
