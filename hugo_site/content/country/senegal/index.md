To date, grant funding has been provided through Pace University (Google, NCIIA, IBM), and local companies.

Established in April 2011, CTIC Dakar is primarily focused on supporting high growth potential ICT entrepreneurs with support from the Government of Senegal, the Telecoms regulator, Orange, World Bank, GIZ and the European Union (Centre for the Development of Enterprise - CDE). CTIC Dakar provides hands-on-business development support and coaching for entrepreneurs, as well as training on financial and communication issues, organises events for young entrepreneurs and has also established in six month duration accelerator program for high potential impact startups. 25% of operating costs are contributed by companies supported (through revenue growth sharing), with 30% grant funding, 25% sponsorship and 20% through delivery of business development services.

It has the objective of encouraging, inspiring and training more women in the tech ecosystem in Senegal through networking, training, mentoring and sharing knowledge.

Established in 2011, HubSocial focused on developing social solutions for Senegal and West Africa, and how ICT can be leveraged to address poverty reduction, health and education. While the Indigo Trust found its work interesting, it no longer appears to be active.

The work of the Senegal Chapter of Coders4Africa has helped strengthen the innovation ecosystem through the number of individuals who have been enabled to develop technology. Students have created apps addressing societal challenges in areas including health, agriculture and education.
