Design Hub Kampala is a co-creation and co-working space in Kampala. The 2000 sqm renovated warehouse is a collaborative work environment where entrepreneurs, freelancers, designers, writers, product developers, marketing minds, tech start-ups, and makers and companies can feel comfortable working on their own projects, while having the possibility of sharing, engaging and working with other like-minded creatives. At the same time, our mission is to show the economic value of creativity and �design thinking� and provide an entry point for international market opportunities.
