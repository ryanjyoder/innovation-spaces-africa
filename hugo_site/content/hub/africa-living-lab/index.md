As of July 2021, this lab does not seem operational.

The ISEG research group at Universit√© Internationale des Diasporas Africaines (UNIDAF) was responsible for establishing the African Living Lab, which focused on developing a network of laboratories across West Africa to promote technology takeup and digital community by youth.
