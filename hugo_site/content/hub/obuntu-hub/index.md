Obuntu Hub is inspired by the notion of �obuntu� which can be translated as �collective progress.� We conceived the hub as a catalyst to drive collective progress for entrepreneurs and the community at large. Our focus is on empowering young entrepreneurs who innovate through tech or unique business models.
