description: Fab Lab New Cairo is an open-maker space and fabrication laboratory to help all makers to turn their ideas into prototypes, located in 5th Settlement, New Cairo, in Giza Systems Building. It's a part of a bigger Makerspace Program run by Giza Systems Education Foundation, which goal is to target eastern Cairo, as there's no accessible prototyping facility for the makers who live there.
