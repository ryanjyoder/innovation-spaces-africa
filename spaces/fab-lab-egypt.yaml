description: Since its launch in 2012, Fab Lab Egypt has become the leader of the maker movement in Egypt and the region. The lack of hands-on learning in education and its impact on the deteriorating economy and industry has led us to believe that we need to revive the making skills of all Egyptians, and to have world-class “Designed and Made in Egypt” products
