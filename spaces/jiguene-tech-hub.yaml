It also aims to increase the number of women in technology and entrepreneurship by encouraging more girls to take STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) subjects in school and university. Pre-incubation space is provided, with an emphasis on businesses with high social potential impact. JJiguene Tech Senegal organises monthly meetings, school and university outreach programs, a mentorship program and ICT and entrepreneurial skills training for girls between the ages of 13 - 25.
