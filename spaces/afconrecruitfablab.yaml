diescription: Our network of business owner and manufacturers and jobseekers will benefit from the fablab. The land where my office is run will be used for phase 1 set up.  We will set up a 3D printing outfit and an inventors lab. The inventor lab will help with new product development for entrepreneurs and existing businesses. We have an existing network that will use the inventors lab. We will create products from wood, iron, plastics, textiles, leather, glass and other materials.  We will also train users of equipment  through a mass training programme with the fablab community and resources.  We will grow the lab with demand for product and training of machine users.
