diescription: We believe that social ventures represent the best opportunity for young people to be able to effect systemic changes in their communities, as well as being central to creating a fairer global economy. And, we believe the biggest roadblock to social venturesâ€™ advancement is not access to finance, but funding readiness. Therefore, we work to support social ventures to build innovative impact and business models, as well as prototypes and user bases, to be ready for funding.
