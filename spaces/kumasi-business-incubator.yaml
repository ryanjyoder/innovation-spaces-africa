diescription: The concept of the Kumasi Business Incubator (KBI) is to initially assist up to twenty-five (25) selected final year students of KNUST to realize their entrepreneurial dreams. The KNUST in collaboration with NBSSI is establishing the Incubator Centre to assist final year students who have innovative business ideas to perfect these ideas into real businesses and to assist tenants to integrate their businesses into the real business world. Most importantly, the incubator seeks to reduce the failure rate of early-stage companies. This business plan is meant for strategic partners to appreciate the incubator concept and to support in terms of investing in the business units in the Incubator. The Centre though multi-disciplinary, will put premium on businesses that have the national development agenda in focus; to this end, ICT enabled processes and engineering solutions as well as applied sciences will be encouraged
