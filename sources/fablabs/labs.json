There are very few committed and activating projects that address young people. Current emancipatory\r\nissues of young people such as Creative Technologies, Digital Culture and Design / Media can not be adequately\r\nconveyed, as there is no lively and open scene on site. The increasing migration of young people from rural regions\r\nis one of the reasons and consequences of this youth and socio-cultural under-supply.\r\n\r\nProject idea\r\n\r\nThe „Fab-Mobil“ is a moving, art and digital laboratory equipped with digital and prototyping technology. It offers\r\nworkshops, courses and an open media workshop regularly and regionally mobile for young people. The bus, which\r\nis equipped with creative technology (3D printer, computer, robotics, virtual reality headsets, etc.), is accompanied\r\nby a trained workshopper, and stops at schools, cultural centers and informal meeting places in East Germany.\r\n\r\nAims and methods\r\n\r\nThere is an extreme leeway in the field of cultural-political education and cultural education with new media. As\r\na society, it is our personal concern to make a socio-political and sustainable contribution to the improvement of\r\nthe cultural, artistic and social competence of young people. With the Fab-Mobil we are fully equipped and come\r\ndirectly to the young people, which is a great advantage in decentralized area regions.\r\nThe aim is to provide a deeper understanding of digitality through regular experimental design using new\r\ntechnologies while at the same time addressing cultural, social and socio-political aspects. In addition, the mobile\r\nart and technology laboratory combines youthful smartphone professionals with work-oriented and partly retired\r\ntechnicians in intergenerational offers. In addition, a transversal generation-based competence transfer is generated\r\nby a continuous and regular learning process.\r\nThrough the mobile nature of the project, a closer networking of the individual culture and educational centers\r\ndistributed in the region is created. Course and workshop offers will be migrated, information material will be\r\ndistributed more widely and attention for a regional cultural offer will be generated. New networks emerge.\r\nThere is currently no comparable project known in Germany. We would like to be the first to offer mobile technology\r\nand culture formats for young people prototypically in rural areas and to investigate exemplary transfer possibilities at\r\nfederal level.\r\n\r\nProcess\r\n\r\nThe project runs from July 4, 2010 to October 31, 2008 on 4 days a week, plus holiday, evening and weekend\r\noffers, at varying locations in the Oberlausitz. The Fab-Mobil offers space and equipment for approx. 15 - 20\r\npersons including the course instructor and possible social workers inside.\r\n\r\nProject period: 01.07.2017-31.10.-2018\r\n- Planning and organization: 01.07.-30.09.2017\r\n- Fab-Mobil on Tour: 01.10.2017-30.09.2018 (including lectures, presentations, public relations)\r\n- Billing and proof of performance: 01.10.-31.10.2018\r\nThe Fab-Mobil sees itself as a meaningful and mobile agent for extraordinary cultural and educational offers. A\r\ndeliberately open cultural laboratory, with a cosmopolitan and intercultural orientation for rural areas. It is about\r\nthe accompanying support and conscious transformation of the young people from the consumer to the cultural\r\nproducer. We promote cultural self-realization in the region, professional qualification and broad socio-cultural\r\nparticipation. Mobile workshops, courses and creative and cultural experience offer a result-oriented experiment and\r\nconvey an open corporate image.\r\nThe Fab-Mobil offers the young future actors a stable and reliable open space with possibilities for the development\r\nand testing of new location-specific, digital cultural formats. Project-based experimentation is important: the free and\r\nsupported experimentation, the joy of the experiment and the playful learning open up new perspectives.\r\nAims of the various workshops:\r\n- Enthusiasm for technology-based and artistic cultures\r\n- Mediation of emancipatory practices / Cultural education\r\n- independent critique of new digital-technological trends\r\n- self-conscious, creative, and socially-reflective approach to (online) technology\r\n- Openly show what is possible with new creative technology and cultural methods\r\n\r\nProject promoters and potential cooperation partners\r\n\r\nChristian Zöllner, CEO of Constitute e.V., is a visiting lecturer for design methods at Burg Giebichenstein Halle and\r\nheads up a design studio in Berlin. Jens Beyer, also a member of the board of directors, is a graduate designer and\r\na mechatronics engineer with a training certificate.\r\nSince 2013, as a collective and private person, we regularly offer creative and technical workshops in the cultural\r\narea of Oberlausitz. We show young people how they can realize their own projects with open source software and\r\n3D printers. Since the beginning of 2017, we have been acting as a registered association Constitute e.V. with the\r\npurpose of the statutes to carry new and modern cultural techniques into rural areas.\r\n\r\nThrough existing projects there is a lively exchange with theaters, cultural centers and medium-sized workshops in\r\nthe region, which will enable the Fab-Mobil access. This link is to be strengthened and further developed in order\r\nto sensitize young people and families to the cultural landscape. In the preparatory phase, mutual cooperation\r\nagreements are concluded with the schools and interested partners\r\nInterested and / or already confirmed project partners are (selection:\r\n- „Landeszentrale für politische Bildung“ Sachsen\r\n- „Steinhaus e.V.“ Bautzen\r\n- „Medienkulturzentrum Dresden“\r\n- „Partnerschaft Demokratie“ und „Weltoffenes Sachsen“\r\n- „Bundesvereinigung kulturelle Kinder- und Jugendbildung“\r\n- „Kulturfabrik e.V.“ Hoyerswerda\r\n\r\nDocumentation and transfer of results\r\n\r\nThe project is carried out as an example in Oberlausitz and is being investigated and prepared for an adaptation for\r\nfurther regions. Intermediate steps are documented and published on the project website. For teenagers, parents\r\nand interested parties there will be an offer overview / timetable on the website.\r\nThrough the strong networking of the members of the Constitute in the German design, art, culture and technology\r\nscene, as well as in the university landscape, we can present the results of the project at conferences, festivals and\r\ncultural-political events. And thus, inspire, motivate and advise other supra-regional actors.

L’expression des jeunes, sous toutes ses formes","description":"Depuis plusieurs années déjà, la MJC met en place des projets destinés à rendre les jeunes acteurs de leurs loisirs et favorise leur engagement citoyen. L’expression des jeunes, sous toutes ses formes (théâtre, danse, musique, vidéo….) est au cœur de son action.\r\nLes jeunes sont de plus en plus intéressés par la culture numérique et l’informatique. Malheureusement, la plupart du temps ils se contentent de consommer des contenus (Youtube, jeux vidéo, réseaux sociaux..). Sur le long terme, ils deviennent de plus en plus passifs vis-à-vis des outils numériques avec parfois une certaine perte de recul.\r\nLa MJC a pour ambition de leur faire découvrir l’univers du numérique sous un angle différent, en leur proposant de participer à des expériences nouvelles, créatives, ludiques et responsables. Dans ce sens, depuis le moin de juin 2017, elle travaille à la création dans ses locaux d’un espace dédié à la culture numérique dans une démarche d’Education populaire. \r\nCe FabLab (Laboratoire de fabrication numérique) aura la spécificité d’être conçu spécialement pour accueillir un public jeune (à partir de 6 ans) et mettra un accent particulier sur les aspects éducatifs et ludiques de la création numérique.\r\nCe projet à pour vocation de :\r\n-\tFavoriser l’expression et développer la créativité des jeunes au travers des concepts de création numérique et du «Do it yourself» (faire soi-même) \r\n-\tRendre acteur le public jeune sur ces concepts\r\n-\tDévelopper leur autonomie \r\n-\tLes sensibiliser aux problématiques actuelles de notre société (écologie, recyclage, obsolescence programmée…)\r\n\r\nPour la mise en place de cette action, la MJC a pu bénéficier de l’expérience de la MJC de Rodez et de son FabLab « Rutech » qui a plus de deux ans d’existence. Ce soutien a été a à la fois logistique (choix du matériel, choix des consommables, organisation de l’espace…) mais aussi et surtout technique. Dans ce sens, le personnel de la MJC a participé à une « formation FabLab »  de trois jours organisée au sein du réseau régional des MJC Midi-Pyrénées début juillet 2017. La Municipalité de Saint-Céré à participé au projet en mettant en œuvre des travaux d’aménagement de la salle qui allait accueillir cette nouvelle activité. Enfin, la MJC a pu bénéficier d’une aide financière conséquente de la CAF du Lot dans le cadre du Fonds Public et Territoire, aide sans laquelle le projet n’aurait pas pu voir le jour.\r\n\r\nPour mettre en avant la spécificité de son FabLab orienté particulièrement sur le public jeune (le plus représenté au sein de ses adhérents), la MJC a souhaité l’appeler « FunLab ». En anglais, « Fun » signifie « amusement, plaisir, marrant… ». \r\n\r\nLes différentes actions mise en place autour de cet espace pour 2018 vont être les suivantes :\r\n\r\n-\tUtilisation du Fun’Lab dans le cadre des animations du CLAS porté par la MJC (animations régulières au collège et le soir à la MJC dans le cadre de l’accompagnement à la scolarité)\r\n-\tProposition d’activités autour du Fun’Lab dans le cadre de l’Accueil de loisirs sans hébergement de la MJC sur les vacances scolaires\r\n-\tMise en place d’un Club Fun’Lab le mercredi après-midi à destination des jeunes, animé par des salariés et des bénévoles de la MJC avec la possibilité de mettre en place des animations parents/enfants.\r\n-\tInviter les structures jeunesse du territoire à venir découvrir (gratuitement) la création numérique au sein de notre Fun’Lab (écoles, collège, lycée, associations locales…)\r\n\r\nCe projet s’inscrit sur le long terme. La seule limite sera la durée de vie du matériel qui devra être renouvelé au moins tous les cinq ans. Dès l’année prochaine, dans la mesure où le projet aura atteint ses objectifs, l’action pourrait prendre de l’ampleur avec la mise en place d’un Fun’Lab itinérant à l’échelle du territoire intercommunal de CAUVALDOR (toujours avec une orientation particulière sur le public enfance-jeunesse).\r\n\r\nLes différentes machines mises à disposition sur le Fun’Lab permettront de réaliser un éventail très large d’activités :\r\n-\tImpression et scan 3D : création d’objets décoratifs, de figurines, de bijoux, d’accessoires pour les portables, Do It Yourself, création de pièces de rechange pour des réparations multiples…\r\n-\tDécoupe vynil : customisation d’objets divers (mugs, portes clés, coques de téléphone, assiettes), création d’autocollants et de stickers (décorations murales)\r\n-\t Presse à chaud : customisation de vêtements (t-shirts, casquettes, sacs à dos…) avec possibilité de transférer des motifs imprimés sur des matières rétro réfléchissantes (sécurité routière).\r\n-\tFraise numérique : équivalent de l’imprimante 3D mais pour le bois (création de pièces en bois, décoration, gravure sur bois…)\r\n-\tCartes arduino/raspberry : initiation à la programmation et à l’électronique (codage, robotique, applications mobiles…)\r\n\r\nLe fonctionnement du FunLab sur des salariés de la MJC mais aussi et surtout sur plusieurs adultes bénévoles comme Alain et Benoît qui s’investissent depuis plusieurs mois sur sa mise en route de ce projet. Les adultes sont d’ailleurs également les bienvenus dans ce lieu qui se veut intergénérationnel. Actuellement ouvert tous les vendredis après-midis, le nombre de créneaux d’ouvertures devraient être étendus à partir de la rentrée des vacances de printemps avec des créneaux en soirée et le mercredi après-midi. N’hésitez-pas à venir rencontrer les bénévoles et salariés de la MJC, ils se feront un plaisir de vous accompagner dans la découverte du FunLab, nouvel outil culturel à disposition des habitants de la commune et aux adhérents de la MJC.\r\n\r\n","slug":"funlab46","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"170 Quai Auguste Salesse","address_2":"","city":"Saint-Céré","county":"","postal_code":"46400","country_code":"FR","latitude":44.8579012,"longitude":1.89569019999999,"address_notes":"","phone":"0565108333","email":"maison-jeunesculture@orange.fr","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":5662,"url":"https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Mjc.Saint.Cere"}]},{"id":1996,"name":"SF FAB LAB","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"The Fab Lab will allow students to create and manufacture prototypes to enhance lab work in the study of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics for students in grades 4-8.","description":"The St. Francis School District envisions creating a Fab Lab by upgrading currently existing lab space at Deer Creek Intermediate Schools 3680 S.

Total school enrollment is roughly 400 students between K-12.","description":"Nestled in in the forests of Northern Wisconsin lies the little township of Wabeno. \r\n\r\nThe name Wabeno comes from the Native American name \"Waubeno\" which means \"the coming of winds\" or \"the opening\".  That is because on June 2, 1880, an enormous storm swept across northern Wisconsin.  This massive swath of devastation consisted of timber blow downs between ½ to 1 mile wide from Antigo, WI all of the way to Lake Superior.  \r\n\r\nThe town itself officially established in 1897 as the name Wabeno.  And like many small towns in Northern Wisconsin at that time, Wabeno centered on the logging industry that would harvest the virgin stands of old growth timber used to fuel the building boom in the United States.  With an established town, in late 1897 the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad built a rail line between Wabeno and Green Bay.  This link officially connected Wabeno to the world through freight and passenger services.  Soon lumber mills were built along the tracks and the town itself grew up around the mills.  Passenger services not only brought people for business purposes, but also for recreation.  The town had moved into a new and \"modern\" age.\r\n\r\nAs technology and transportation methods changed in the coming decades, so did the town.  Horses, trains, and steam-powered engines used to move logs were replaced with diesel-driven equipment and trucks.  As transportation became easier and the economy changed, the lumber mills shuttered their doors.  Cross-cut saws and axes were replaced with chainsaws, and eventually computer controlled harvesters.  Rather than riding the rails, tourists began to use cars to get to a destination where they would go camping, skiing, four-wheeling, or snowmobiling.  The train tracks laid in the late 1800's were removed or covered over, and recreational vehicles began to ride on the old railroad beds.  The town had adjusted to a new age.\r\n\r\nWhile smaller elementary schools dotted the area, the High School's role began in earnest when in 1906 the first High School was built.  However, in 1936 a fire destroyed the entire high school except for the newly added gym.  A year later the high school was rebuilt and over the years it has expanded and adjusted to suit the requirements of the students and the local population.  A walk down the halls of the school shows every graduating class from 1937 to present day, which is a unique thing to see.  And because the logging industry was and still is such a central role to the community, the school's mascot is \"Larry the Log Roller\".\r\n\r\nAnd much like the changes the town experienced through its history, the school district felt them as well.  Community members, the school board, and teachers began to realize that there was a growing need for a skilled and creative work force to compete in the global market.  As such, the district took on the daunting task to start a Fab Lab to achieve that end, which would incorporate all grades from Kindergarten to 12th grade.  The sole purpose of this facility was to nurture each child's inner creativity by giving them the tools they needed to make a difference.  In order to get the funding, the district asked the area voters in the spring election of 2017 to approve a one-time $300,000 expenditure to start the Fab Lab.  With overwhelming support, the voters approved the referendum.\r\n\r\nWisely using this money, the school began to make major changes to the building infrastructure.  Old and under-powered electrical systems were removed and replaced with systems that could safely supply the needed power for the new machinery being installed in the Fab Lab and the Tech Ed areas.  Old and unsafe woodworking and metalworking equipment (some of which was 60+ years old) were removed and upgraded with modern and safer equipment.  The layout of the Tech Ed area was completely revamped, and by January of 2018, the Wabeno School District had a state of the art facility.\r\n\r\nEquipment such as 3-D Printers, Laser Engravers, a CNC Router, and a CNC Plasma Cutter (to name a few) were brought in to give the students a \"digital fabrication\" experience.  New computers with the kinds of software that many of the world’s major companies use to design their products were brought in to drive this machinery.  The school had built a place where students and members of the community could come in and create whatever their minds could think up.  \r\n\r\nThe community and the school have come a long way since the 1800's.

Most of the hardware featured in these work spaces are easily controlled by user friendly software programs installed on desktop computers no different than the ones we use at work or home. The intent of the Fab Lab is to put this sophisticated machinery in the hands of students as young as middle school exposing them to engineering and design by giving them the opportunity to turn ideas into tangible products.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab concept began as an outreach program at MIT that aimed to promote creativity and innovation among students. By giving students the necessary tools and fostering an environment where imagination to invent and create was encouraged, Fab Labs quickly gained popularity with fab labs now being created in opened in rural India, northern Norway, Afghanistan, Ghana, Boston and Costa Rica. Users are finding that students who are able to apply design and engineering concepts toward the creation of real things are able to learn much more than they could through just exams or textbooks.\r\n\r\nThis has definitely been the case at CITC’s fab lab, where Alaskan Native students are discovering the sky’s the limit when working within a supportive community with access to the right tools. With some basic instruction and training provided by an on-site adviser, students who often struggle in a traditional educational environment are now running many of the standard machines in the Fab Lab – 3D printers, laser and vinyl cutters – to create a wide range of products made from wood, metal and plastic. This type of hands-on learning experience exposes the students to a wide range of design, engineering and architectural concepts in a fun, holistic way that cannot be achieved in the classroom. \r\n\r\nWhen students transform a simple idea into a tangible finished product, they get an overwhelming sense of accomplishment – not to mention a lot of handy products. Some of the student-created items proudly on display in the workshop include decorative wool scarves, a Spanish-style classical guitar, personalized paper stationary, and even spare automotive parts. During the holidays, students took advantage of the workshops to create Christmas ornaments and custom silk-screen t-shirts that were given as gifts to family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil recently, it wasn’t feasible for small operations to access this type of cutting-edge technology. CITC understands this opportunity at hand and is working toward developing multiple fab lab programs, both for youth and adults that will continue to connect people with technology through education. \r\n","slug":"citcfablab","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"3600 San Jeronimo Ct","address_2":"","city":"Anchorage","county":"","postal_code":"99508","country_code":"US","latitude":61.2108446650145,"longitude":-149.810683623279,"address_notes":"","phone":"907-793-3630","email":"fablab@citci.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":null,"links":[]},{"id":1749,"name":"Nodelab Guidonia Montecelio","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Spazio di ricerca sul rapporto tra arte, scienza e nuove tecnologie.","description":"Nodelab Guidonia Montecelio nasce come spin-off dell’Accademia Dei Romani, dall’unione del know-how della Grillo Design Studio e di WiFi Informatica, due realtà attive da anni sul territorio nel campo del design e della fabbricazione digitale.\r\n\r\nVogliamo diventare uno spazio di ricerca d’avanguardia, il cui obiettivo è quello di ragionare sugli enormi mutamenti che stanno avvenendo in questi anni: Intelligenza Artificiale, Neuroscienze, Digital Fabrication. \r\n\r\nObiettivi del progetto sono:\r\n\r\n• la diffusione della cultura maker e open source sul territorio di Guidonia Montecelio attraverso attività di formazione e divulgazione; \r\n• supportare le attività economiche del territorio nella transizione digitale verso l’industria 4.0 attraverso consulenze e servizi di prototipazione rapida; \r\n• svolgere attività di ricerca in ambito creativo e culturale indagando l’interazione tra arte, scienza e nuove tecnologie.\r\n","slug":"nodelabguidoniamontecelio","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/11/09/20/04/46/dc294999-a615-4af2-9547-6ee78fb70aef/logo png.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/11/09/20/04/09/622827dc-a156-4058-b3f3-f4952f8cd37d/logotipo.png","address_1":"Via Romana, 159","address_2":"Via Romana, 159","city":"Guidonia Montecelio","county":"Roma","postal_code":"00012","country_code":"IT","latitude":41.964667,"longitude":12.7610082,"address_notes":"C/O Accademia Dei Romani","phone":"3332707024","email":"info@nodelab.eu","capabilities":["three_d_printing","circuit_production","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":7144,"url":"https://www.nodelab.eu"}]},{"id":1616,"name":"FabLab Benfica","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":208,"blurb":"Fab Lab Benfica takes the name of the surrounding neighborhood in Lisbon while sitting inside the Higher School of Education at the Polytechnic of Lisbon.","description":"Fab Lab Benfica takes the name of the surrounding neighborhood in Lisbon while sitting inside the Higher School of Education at the Polytechnic of Lisbon.\r\nThis means that it is aimed at establishing strong ties with the local community empowering this spirit inside the schools own community.\r\n","slug":"fablabbenfica","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/02/01/11/35/21/07f6c254-2b60-46db-a262-37699db3f959/profilePIC3.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/07/12/19/53/25/f874732c-dfe0-4351-9d34-006ffd80eb5c/FBheader_2.png","address_1":"FabLab Benfica","address_2":"Escola Superior de Educação de Lisboa - Campus de Benfica do IPL","city":"Lisboa","county":"","postal_code":"1549-003","country_code":"PT","latitude":38.746159,"longitude":-9.1953072,"address_notes":"It is inside the school, Don't be shy.

Marin Country Day School continues to water and nurture this seed which has grown to include five distinct spaces or environments each with unique attributes and players.  The environments continue to develop through a constant examination of what is possible with past, current and future technologies and materials in a digital landscape.  \r\n\r\nIn Space 1, the germinating space, an electronics and tinkering space was born for 7 students.  This quickly became a nexus for those wanting to dive deep in the electromechanical realms in all ages.  This space was outgrown quickly and is still in use today.  Space 2 sprouted from the molten fragments of former cast off metal chunks and became a space to develop and manipulate in metal.  Welding, forging, and smithing shaped this small space for six students to work metal.  Space 3 grew out of a need for bigger tools and the need to involve the arts in our making discoveries.  A new art room has been slowly morphed to include 3d printers, foam milling, laser cutting, big wood working tools.  Space 3a was a natural \"burst at the seams\" location directly outside Space 3.

It is registered as a civil society non-profit organization in Libya . Our lab basically provides public access to an adequately (but not fully) equipped Laboratory for digital fabrication and electronic innovation . It has been ,so far, focusing in hosting training courses for kids and youth in programming, electronics and robotics , as well as running supervised DIY clubs for kids , various workshops and participating in events such as the first National Robotics championship in Libya . Furthermore, in pursuing its role as a STEAM education promoter in Libya , the lab has developed a curriculum for teaching programming to kids and contracted with a number of private elementary schools in Benghazi for teaching the curriculum to their students . \r\n\r\nOne of the very successful projects carried out by the lab , so far , was the 100 youth engineers and the 100 youth programmers ; in which a large number of school students participated in a hands-on learning style training course on the basics of programming and electronics using Arduino development panel. At the end of the course ,the students were able to build their own Arduino projects or Android applications and participated in an end-of-course competition. \r\n\r\nThe lab has been providing the equipment required and the technical assistance for a number of more advanced college graduation projects. And this is the area which we want to work on further ,by encouraging people ,specially electronic engineers and IT graduates , to engage in building their own (advanced) prototypes. Ultimately, our lab aims to become a real research and innovation center. \r\n\r\nRecently , Fab Lab Libya has engaged on a project by Expertise France concerned with entrepreneurship . Through this project members of the Fab Lab are being trained in entrepreneur coaching,where the lab is required to train and coach female entrepreneurs to establish their businesses . In addition to carrying out workshops on entrepreneurship to youth and specifically to university students .

El FabLab IICA fue inaugurado el 17 de julio de 2019.\r\n\r\nDada la apremiante necesidad de avanzar en la incorporación en las tecnologías como una oportunidad para la agricultura, se ha dispuesto como objetivo del FabLab IICA promover el desarrollo e implementación de la Agricultura Digital, a partir de la alfabetización digital, el incremento de capacidades y la gestión de innovaciones para el sector agrario. Este objetivo parte desde una perspectiva de alcance nacional, por la naturaleza de las relaciones que dan origen al FabLab, pero con una visión final de logros hemisféricos, dados los mandatos del IICA y la necesidad de innovar en el sector agrícola. \r\n\r\nLa estrategia del trabajo del FabLab IICA se basa en metodologías para la Gestión de la Innovación enfocada en la Agricultura Digital. Se espera organizar redes de apoyo, reducir la brecha digital en ámbitos rurales, promover la co-creación de prueba de conceptos en soluciones para la agricultura, incrementar capacidades tecnológicas y digitales en actores del sector agrario. El asesoramiento y escalamiento del modelo FabLab para otros países del hemisferio es una meta asociada a la atracción de recursos para las inversiones necesarias en la implementación de la Agricultura Digital.\r\n","slug":"iicafablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/15/20/57/31/8e8a0868-df10-4ccb-b8b7-d97eb2fe414f/High Res ICON.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/05/05/16/16/05/aabbe9f7-6138-4a30-864a-b949aa462acb/WhatsApp Image 2020-02-28 at 09.01.37 (1)(1).jpeg","address_1":"600 m. noreste del Cruce Ipís-Coronado","address_2":"Coronado Vásquez de Coronado, San Isidro 11101","city":"San Jose","county":"San Jose","postal_code":"11101","country_code":"CR","latitude":9.9688837,"longitude":-84.0176397,"address_notes":"Sede Central IICA","phone":"+506 2216-0222","email":"jonathan.castro@iica.int","capabilities":["three_d_printing"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":8985,"url":"https://www.iica.int/es/countries/costa-rica"}]},{"id":123,"name":"Mediterranean Fab Lab","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"MEDAARCH","description":"","slug":"mediterraneanfablab","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"Via Alcide de Gasperi, 23","address_2":"","city":"Cava de' Tirreni","county":"Campania","postal_code":"84013","country_code":"IT","latitude":40.7052988160927,"longitude":14.7052032485016,"address_notes":"","phone":"","email":"","capabilities":[],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":245,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/medfablab.cava"},{"id":246,"url":"http://www.pinterest.com/medfablabcava/"}]},{"id":1724,"name":"Matusa FabLab Sciacca","kind_name":"mini_fab_lab","parent_id":275,"blurb":"At the moment we are mainly oriented towards prototyping and 3D printing, so we have machines that are useful for this purpose","description":"The attempt to share the experience and technological know-how and to lay the foundations for creating a cultural fabric linked to digital production, in a place like Southern Italy that does not have","slug":"matusafablabsciacca","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"Via Porta San Pietro, 29","address_2":"","city":"Sciacca","county":"Agrigento","postal_code":"92019","country_code":"IT","latitude":37.5072399,"longitude":13.0817278,"address_notes":"","phone":"","email":"matusafablab@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","laser"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":5738,"url":"http://www.matusafablab.it"}]},{"id":2072,"name":"kalubyaFaLab","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":13,"blurb":"","description":"","slug":"fablabkalubya","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/07/21/22/07/41/a4d1504e-7ac8-45b0-bc3c-dc08efcdf958/Fab_Lab_logo.svg.png","header_url":null,"address_1":"El Obour City","address_2":"","city":"El Obour City","county":"","postal_code":"","country_code":"EG","latitude":30.2283408,"longitude":31.4798948,"address_notes":"","phone":"","email":"gad.elhebry@stemkalubya.moe.edu.eg","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[]},{"id":2418,"name":"Fab Lab Escola SESI - Ipiranga ","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":1152,"blurb":"Fab Lab Escola SESI Ipiranga-SP is laboratory connected to the network and its ideals, located in Ipiranga in the south of São Paulo, seeking to disseminate science and technology in its community.","description":"A Fab Lab is a prototyping platform for innovation and invention by providing a stimulus to local entrepreneurship.

It was founded as a limited company in 2005 by Mario de Alfonso Ballester, a maquettist and designer with over 25 years experience. He has always worked in this sector, which is why a large proportion of our clients are of many years’ standing. We have earned the loyalty of our clients.\r\n\r\nMario de Alfonso also teaches “Architectural Maquetting” at the European University of Valencia and \"do it yourself\" at Barreira Desigh School. He also collaborates with the EASD of Valencia in a teaching capacity and teaches at the Architectural Valencia Politecnic University (UPV)\r\nOceanonaranja is also the oficial headquarters of the wokshop of the European University of Valencia and it students came to be trained and to build their own prototypes and models.\r\n\r\nHis contribution to the sector is broad and varied, his large-scale, emblematic works including the maquettes of the macro project for the City of the Arts and Sciences, the maquette of the Port of Valencia for Consorcio 2007 and the celebration of the 32nd America’s Cup and the two replicas of the LEM lunar module, one for the Prince Felipe Science Museum and the other for the planetarium in Majorca, together with maquettes for the emblematic buildings at Expo Zaragoza 2007 and the collection of 28 maquettes for the Memory of Andalusia Museum in Granada.\r\n\r\nIt is important to underline that Oceanonaranja has continuously adapted to new technologies and today it is a modern company that makes permanent endeavours to improve the quality of its projects by bringing into its technical team all of the new developments in mechanical and/or computerised tools that appear on the market.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that 20 years ago, maquettes were made entirely by hand. Computerisation did not exist and this adaptation has required an enormous business, economic and professional effort. \r\n\r\nWe are always ready to try a new material, a different machine or an unknown manufacturing process. Our keywords are development and innovation in all fields.\r\n\r\nOceanonaranja SL is working hard to become an inseparable part of the museography of this country and is being rewarded through many commissions in the sector and the large number of maquettes that we have specifically designed and produced for museums and exhibitions. \r\n\r\nOceanonaranja is a modern company, keen to adapt by the day to new technologies and so it makes ongoing efforts to improve the quality of its projects by incorporating all of the new mechanical and/or computerised tools that appear on the market into its technical team.\r\n\r\nOceanonaranja today has the latest generation of numerical control cutting machines.\r\n\r\n-Multicam Mod. I-304-R Router, 3000x2000x250mm, for cutting and milling all kinds of plastic, polystyrene foam, wood and soft metals.\r\n \r\n-COMAGRAV Router, 700x1400x120mm\r\n\r\n-Laser Engraver Red Sail 1200x900, alternative to the above for smaller jobs\r\n\r\n-LASERPRO Mercury laser engraver, 640x640mm, \r\n\r\n-Laser engraver, 1000x2000mm, assembled by Aplus, 100w, for cutting all types of organic material, such as paper, cardboard, PMMA and plywood of up to 10mm.\r\n\r\n-3D printer Wasp Delta 2040 mm, for the printing of any piece that has been computer modelled, creating three-dimensional plastic pieces.\r\n\r\nThe trajectory of Oceano, as a company, and of its founder Mario de Alfonso together with current tendencies and needs, have made us humbly think that we are and have always been a fabrication laboratory. \r\nWe would like to be a part of the FabLab community and once we will became a part of it, we have the following goals:\r\n\r\n-to teach the handling of CNC machines and 3D printers\r\n-to be a place where every one can came to be helped with his fabrication problems\r\n-to be place where you can use CNC machines and 3D printing ones\r\n-to a be place for seminars and workshops\r\n-to work in collaboration with the FabLab Valencia \r\n-to innovate and invent using technology and digital fabrication to allow anyone to make (almost) anything,\r\n-to create opportunities to improve lives of anyone \r\n\r\n\r\nThe technology used by Oceanonaranja, together with the proven experience of our workforce, partners and members, guarantee optimum results in this our last project\r\n","slug":"oceanonaranjafablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/05/01/21/29/13/7f8c3a9e-10bf-4643-b7de-b892b29df899/FABLAB2.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/10/18/17/48/28/b28b0189-53dc-44f2-a75d-1bb101ef8e73/slider_foot-100x0.jpg","address_1":"Calle Botiguers, 5","address_2":"Polígono 3","city":"Alboraia","county":"valencia","postal_code":"46120","country_code":"ES","latitude":39.4991201,"longitude":-0.336469599999987,"address_notes":"","phone":"+34962515755","email":"fablab@oceanonaranja.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"planned","links":[{"id":4634,"url":"http://www.oceanonaranja/fablab.com"},{"id":4635,"url":"http://oceanonaranja.com/blog/"},{"id":4636,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/oceano.naranja.9"},{"id":4637,"url":"https://es.pinterest.com/ocanonaranja/"}]},{"id":161,"name":"FabLab Tsukuba","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"FabLab Tsukuba is communication space for scientists, engineers, and artists.

A global-first wearable tech product was launched for Durex; Fundawear, remote controlled underwear that transfers touch via mobile. After significant research we developed ingestible electronics with Bluetooth for a campaign, which involved someone taking on the challenge and eating it. When Oculus’ first development kits first arrived in Australia it took Snepo only 3 weeks to build our own 3D engine to demo VR at a conference. When it comes to new technology we do things first and develop at breakneck speed. \r\n\r\nSnepo Labs is the first certified FabLab on the East Coast of Australia. At Snepo Labs we are bringing together universities, corporates and startups to accelerate the time to market using the latest digital fabrication tools.

The Lab Maker MS appears to meet the demand of industry 4.0 consumers, robotics and IoT in various themes such as agribusiness, education, food, architecture and engineering, fashion, medicine, among others.\r\nThe Laboratory offers a list of machines and equipment that allow digital manufacturing from conception to the materialization of projects, provides technical support for the development of projects through the \"Prototype\" project acceleration track and has a support network of mentors and partners to help with the actions.\r\nThe Lab Maker MS holds the open day every second Saturday of the month, being an open day to receive people interested in experiencing what a Lab Maker MS is. With an open schedule, it allows participants to learn about equipment, supplies, projects already developed and under development. The Open Day is also an opportunity for entrepreneurs and society to better understand the laboratory and the maker culture and bring their projects or participate in solutions and products from the Lab Maker MS event/action schedule.\r\nWe also carry out workshops such as the Maker Experience Day, which is a 2 to 3 hour workshop, which aims to explain what the maker culture is, do it yourself, both in theory (operation and size of this market in Brazil and in the world), and in practice (equipment and its functioning and composition, opportunity to experience the creation of a simple prototype). Thus, the whole dynamic of the workshop is to demonstrate the entrepreneurial and innovative solutions and possibilities that arise within a prototyping laboratory.\r\nAnother type of workshop we carry out are the Lab Maker MS Workshops for training on specific topics with the purpose of deepening the technical part, applications and practices. It is also a moment for exchanging participants' experiences and their already experienced applications, cases and other projects that reference the global market and its innovations, such as the use of what is available in the fab lab network.\r\nIn addition to workshops, we promote Talks and Meetups with the community, which are meetings for networking, with the purpose of sharing knowledge and generating opportunities for doing business and establishing connections to strengthen culture, prototyping and hardware solutions.\r\nThe Lab Maker MS SEBRAE/MS is getting a complete set of equipment for their lab. As off today they have almost all the equipment and are in the process of buying the precision CNC and the Router CNC which will arrive in November 2021.Besides that Lab Maker MS will go thru a process of renovation in the end of 2021. That will change their structure getting not only new equipment but also compressed air and exhaustion lines.\r\n","slug":"labmakerlivinglabms","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/11/12/20/55/44/d5fe136a-4a93-43d6-a4a8-7a1f4fcd9f38/Logo.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2021/11/12/20/55/44/a54e10c5-8bae-4150-b0f2-06846ebce1dd/lab maker.jpg","address_1":"Rua Brasil, 205","address_2":"","city":"Campo Grande","county":"Mato Grosso do Sul ","postal_code":"79010-230","country_code":"BR","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"address_notes":"","phone":"+55673389-5550","email":"livinglabms@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","laser","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":38047,"url":"https://www.livinglabms.com.br/"}]},{"id":2432,"name":"Fab Lab Escola SESI - Sertãozinho","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":1152,"blurb":"Fab Lab Escola SESI Sertãozinho is a digital manufacturing laboratory focused on education.","description":"A Fab Lab is a prototyping platform for innovation and invention that encourages local entrepreneurship.

Onderdeel hiervan is de knalgele Kaasfabriek promocontainer die mobiel inzetbaar is voor festivals, schoolpleinen en evenementen. Er is een wekelijks open inloop waar je altijd welkom bent om kennis te maken. Kijk in de agenda voor alle activiteiten.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSIE\r\nOpzetten en uitbouwen van de Kaasfabriek tot de hub waar creatieve makers op een zo jong mogelijke leeftijd – samen met professionals en hobbyisten – delen in en bijdragen aan de groeiende “open” bron van technische kennis en vaardigheden.\r\n\r\nDROOM – DOE – DEEL\r\n\r\nIn de Kaasfabriek gaat veel om de 3D’s. Je komt binnen met een DROOM of een idee. Vervolgens ga je aan de slag met de machines. Je gaat het dus zelf DOEN. En daarna DEEL je je kennis van het maken en je eindproduct met de andere kaasmakers. Iedereen mag na het doen van de Basiscursus FabLab zelf de machines bedienen, zoals 3D printers, lasercutters, vinylsnijders en meer. Je ontmoet hier andere makers en bent samen of alleen bezig met het ontwikkelen van nieuwe producten .  Er is altijd een labmanager en/of een vrijwilliger aanwezig die je kan helpen tijdens het maakproces door kennis, vaardigheden en voorzieningen aan te bieden. De Kaasfabriek is vrij toegankelijk voor individuele creatieve “makers” als voor “makers” die projectmatig samen werken.\r\n\r\nIn een fablab wordt een maker uitgedaagd een prototype, maquette, kunstobject of ander product te ontwerpen en te maken. De Kaasfabriek heeft een ‘open’ karakter waarbij iedereen wordt gestimuleerd om kennis van het ontwerpen, het maakproces en het resultaat met elkaar te delen middels een-op-een gesprekken, door dingen vast te leggen in beeld, tekst en geluid en door het geven van trainingen en workshops.\r\n\r\nKaasfabriek FabLab regio Alkmaar is een stichting zonder winstoogmerk. De Kaasfabriek wordt mogelijk gemaakt door inzet van vrijwilligers en diverse partners.\r\n\r\nVOOR WIE?\r\nDe Kaasfabriek FabLab regio Alkmaar is er voor creatieve makers van 2 – 100 jaar uit de regio Alkmaar- Haarlem – Hoorn – Den Helder. Denk aan: vormgevers, kunstenaars, architecten, ontwerpers, modelbouwers, modeontwerpers, case modders, robotbouwers, scholieren, studenten en andere makers van producten.","slug":"kaasfabriek","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/18/48/8ed23ed2-eed9-48e0-82ae-6b25b93f681b/Kaasfabriek | FabLab regio Alkmaar.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/13/55/21/e62656fe-fc1e-4395-aa68-808444b158ed/Kaasfabriek | FabLab regio Alkmaar.jpg","address_1":"Pettemerstraat 15","address_2":"","city":"Alkmaar","county":"Noord-Holland","postal_code":"1823 CW","country_code":"NL","latitude":52.6383743774346,"longitude":4.7506271767212,"address_notes":"De Kaasfabriek staat op het buitenterrein naast HAL25.","phone":"0031657175044","email":"info@kaasfabriek.nl","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":915,"url":"http://www.kaasfabriek.nl"},{"id":916,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/kaasfabriek"},{"id":954,"url":"http://www.twitter.com/kaasfab"}]},{"id":1531,"name":"Onl'fait","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Onl’Fait is the first open educational Fablab in Geneva, where everybody is welcome to learn, make, share, teach, fix, create, discuss, fail and tinker every day of the week.","description":"Onl’Fait is the first open educational Fablab in Geneva, a «third place» dedicated to science, technology and society, a space where to work, learn and teach in a collaborative environment.

From the Beijing Wang Fujing street and Deng Shikou street junction as a starting point, Go straight Deng Shikou street from West to East, Walking about 330 meters, on your left side is the Beijing Jing Shan school. Beijing Jing Shan School is a set of primary school and middle school in one, who is the Asian cultural renewal model school and the United Nations plan to contact center. Deng Xiaoping, who is the leading core of the second generation of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, once wrote an inscription for the Jing Shan School: \"education should be geared to modernization, the world and the future.”\r\nThen go into school and walk 60 meters, and turn right 50 meters, you will see the entrance of teaching building 。Go to the stairs on your left, and get into the 4 floor of the teaching building, go straight about 20 meters after go down the stairs，you will see the Center for Innovation Laboratory in your right hands。  \r\nOur team\r\n\r\nFounder\r\nThe FabLab C+ lab was created by Eric Ma and the Teacher of the Jing Shan School.\r\n Eric Ma was a Maker, Senior Education Expert, National Professional Tutor, who was invited to many FabLab’s activities and meetings, including the FabLab 2016 Shenzhen. Eric led the team to invent a lot of interesting products, including creative light, smart casual shooting device, Trojans, sailing, storage box, and incense box and so on. In the future, Eric will lead the team to design Fab Lab courses, including FabLab C+ Basic、STEAM Struts、Model、A. \r\n\r\nWe have a creative and spirit sharing team, everyone is a learner, a maker and a sharer. Each person is out of the ordinary, but attracts each other. Our team consists of the Makers and Operations. Eric, Ma, Ten Ki, Sam, Jeff, Sean, Connor are makers, who are mainly responsible for creating products and curriculum development. Jack Liu is the operations managers。  \r\n\r\nOur team, adhering to the concept of learning, creating and sharing, has worked together to design and build this laboratory. We look forward to being able to connect with Fab Lab all over the world and look forward to learning, creating and improving together.\r\n\r\nOur Lab and machines\r\nOur laboratory area is close to 100 square meters, and the whole lab is mainly divided into 3 separate spaces. They are Free space, Gray space, and Precision manufacturing space. The Free space about 60 square meters, Gray space about 20 square meters, Precision manufacturing space about 10 square meters.\r\n\r\nWe have 9 types of consumer equipment and 2 purification systems, including 3D scanner, printer, two parallel arm 3D printer, two double 3D printer, 3D printing pen, laser cutting machine, printing machine, cutting machine, desktop CNC ,CNC milling machine, dust collecting filter, gas purification and filtration system. We also have 24 Lenovo notebooks, 4 Dell servers, 5 work tables, 1 mobile projectors, 1 white boards and 1 blackboards.\r\n\r\nWhat we do with Free Space, Gray Space, Precision manufacturing?\r\n\r\nThe Free Space is used to place Lenovo notebooks, work tables, mobile projectors, white boards and blackboards, where students or makers can use notebooks, take notes and discuss exchanges. The teacher uses the projector to display PPT or wonderful movies, animations, and ideas. Whiteboard and blackboard facilitate the teacher's timely marking of the core of creativity, and show to students.\r\n\r\nThe Gray Space is used to decorate our various customer handling tools, such as laser cutting machine, printing machine, cutting machine, desktop CNC ,CNC milling machine, dust collecting filter, gas purification and filtration system. We use these tools to make a lot of interesting and useful products, such as: creative light, smart casual shooting device, Trojans, sailing, storage box, incense box.\r\n\r\nThe Precision manufacturing area is used to place 3D scanners, parallel arm 3D printers, two axis 3D printers, two axis dual head 3D printers, and 3D print pens. We have 6 3D ordinary printers and a parallel arm 3D printer. We can print the 3D model quickly .We use these machines to create a lot of interesting models, such as real models, simulated hearts.\r\n\r\nThe three spaces are independent and combined with each other.\r\n\r\nWhat we have done in the past 10 months?\r\n\r\nFabLab C+ was transformed from a classroom, our maker created it by an automatic hand drawing model, printed models and drawings.\r\n\r\nWe do a little bit of remodeling by ourselves, adding interesting and useful equipment, creating interesting pieces of work. You'll be surprised at a classroom full of desks and chairs became labs. Every experienced students are very surprised, they could not imagine that they can make interesting products by themselves, connecting with Fab Lab all over the world, and connecting with makers in the United States, Europe, Africa and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe FabLab C+ laboratory has a variety of practical and innovative activities. Many activities will open the mysterious gate of the laboratory for you, such as Open Days, Digital Manufacturing, and Teaching Research and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur future\r\n\r\nFirst, we plan to open 4 courses a week, and Open Night once a month.\r\n\r\nSecond, we want to connection with the world, have a dialogue with Fab Labs all over the world, and share ideas, tools, and source code.  \r\n\r\nAt last, we want to be China's stem education practice base, and provide maximum support for students and creative customers. We will continue to build localization courses suitable for k12 education in China, including Fab Lab basic courses (basic tool use), innovative courses and integrated courses. We want to be a regional platform and a landmark Laboratory for students, teachers, and makers.\r\n","slug":"fablabc","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/01/10/07/23/41/0ca92742-1484-4f2b-9df0-e98c413d6608/WeChat Image_20180109214348.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/03/13/14/44/58/ac24de93-d5ec-4281-b0fc-8d6f045e15ec/微信图片_20180313182645.jpg","address_1":"53 Deng Shi Kou Da Jie, DongDan, Dongcheng Qu, Beijing Shi, China","address_2":"Center for Innovation Laboratory, 4 floor, Teaching building, Beijing Jing Shan School","city":"Beijing","county":"Beijing","postal_code":"100006","country_code":"CN","latitude":39.919024,"longitude":116.415018,"address_notes":"","phone":"+86 18601099209","email":"lyf@cgreat.net","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":5280,"url":"http://www.fablabbj.com/ "}]},{"id":91,"name":"Blue Valley School District's Center for Advanced Professional Studies","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":null,"description":null,"slug":"bluevalleyschooldistrictscenterforadvancedprofessionalstudies","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":null,"address_2":null,"city":"Overland Park","county":"Kansas","postal_code":"66204","country_code":"US","latitude":38.9822282,"longitude":-94.6707917,"address_notes":null,"phone":null,"email":null,"capabilities":[],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":123,"url":"http://www.bvcaps.org"}]},{"id":1665,"name":"CoMakingSpace","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"The CoMakingSpace is an open workshop in Heidelberg, aiming to provide everyone with the tools, space and skills to make whatever they come up with. 24/7 access is available if needed!","description":"We have workshops for woodworking, metalworking, CNC routing, 3D printing and electronics with an ever-growing selection of tools and machines - as soon as possible, we would also like to add laser cutting and whatever else our member base wants to use!

We have been helped by Francesco Bombardi and Fernando Arias of the Fablab Reggio-Emilia, Andrea Danielli of Make in Italy association and Massimo Menichinelli of Make in Italy CDB fundation Onlus. After visiting several Fablabs in Italy (Fablab Torino, Fablab Reggio-Emilia, MakeinBo) and done our homework of studying several fablab in Europe (Fablab Barcellona, Aalto Factory, etc) we decided that it was time to open a Fablab in Parma.\r\n\r\nON/OFF Fablab Parma is a brainchild of \"ON/OFF Officina di Coworking\" which is a innovative service of the office of the Mayor of Parma and it is managed by \"Gruppo Scuola\" in collaboration with the Association of Social Promotion ON/OFF.\r\n\r\nON/OFF is a three stages project divided in CO-MAKE-SELL: COWORKING - FABLAB - MAKER'S SHOP.\r\n\r\nThe Coworking opened its doors on the 23rd of November 2013with the main goal to promote an aggregation point of freelancers and Startups. Currently we have people from different sectors from webdesigners, software engineers, film makers, journalists, writers, illustrators, graphic designers, European funding researchers, app developer, etc.\r\nRecently On/off partner also with an incubator (Parma-in)for Start-ups.\r\n\r\nThe different skills has created an environment rich of creativity and sparked new business opportunity for the professionals working there.\r\n\r\nThe help of the local government of Parma has been essential to help the growing of the project, since they helped giving the use of the location were at the moment the Coworking if base and where the Fablab has a place to live. The Fablab is looking for a bigger place since we are growing in number of associated and in number of Tools at the disposal of the community.\r\n\r\nOn/Off is also a universe made of space for artist to expose their work, for designer to create their clothes to the several workshops we have done till now.\r\n\r\nWE are very weary and it is of paramount importance to educate for this we work together with local schools and showing the interesting world of the 3d Printing, or with coderdojo teaching the beauty of coding software to young kids.\r\nWe are doing several courses to introduce the 3D printing revolution open to everyone and we are in the process to work on a new calendar of workshops starting in September/October 2014.\r\n\r\nWe are part of the \"virtuous network\" it's a network of organization who manage to be in continuos connection with the local people, being self-sustainable and create a link between the people and the territory where they live.\r\n\r\nThe coworkers and fabbers give back to the community as volunteer on several social projects, this is part of the mission we agree when we enter in ON/OFF Coworiking and Fablab and this is the reason the price of admission to use the services is lower than other places, because we give back to the community of Parma.\r\n\r\n At the moment we fulfilled only two stages of the project: the Coworking and the Fablab. At the moment we are working on the next phase, thus the Maker's shop, where the digital manufacturing artisan and artist will have a physical place where to sell their creations and where the services of the Coworking and the Fablab will be offered to the local community.\r\n\r\n We are young in respect of other Fablab but we are very lucky since we have a great community with amazing competences.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we are working on implementing a robotic hand within the Fablab and We aim with one of the group to research and produce a low cost prosthesis arm and hand and tools for disabled people.\r\n\r\nWe are working on an original 3D Printer the Coobot of one of our group 3DPR.\r\n\r\nWe are working on how to create objects with 3D printers to help Blind people in the museum to recognize and touch a smaller version of a statue for example, this is done by the 3D ArcheoLab group.\r\n\r\nWe have already partecipated and show our project during:\r\n- Torino Mini Maker Faire;\r\n- Rome Maker Faire;\r\n- New York Maker Faire;\r\n- 3D Print Hub profesional faire in Parma (Mecspe) and in Bologna (Exposanità);\r\n- R2B part of Smau in Bologna;\r\n- FAB10 Barcellona.\r\n\r\nIn the Fablab we have the following groups:\r\n- Biohacking in collaboration with Fabiana Ciciriello;\r\n- Fablab kids (for kids from 4 to 14 years old) with Michela Grasselli and \"Le quattro Mani\";\r\n- Heritage Lab in collaboration with 3D ARCHEOLAB and Giulio Bigliardi;\r\n- Wearable and Fashion technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least we are part of Mak-ER the regional network of Fablabs of the Region Emilia Romagna.

La vecindad tiene autonomía en relación a los objetos de diseño y los temas que se trabajan. \r\n\r\n\"UNA COMUNIDAD DE TRABAJO\" que tiene una mezcla de trabajos de arte, de arquitectura, de urbanismo, de diseño, artesanías, manuales, tecnológicos, comerciales, etc. Creemos que cada trabajo tiene un valor y una dignidad asociada a la comprensión de todas las tareas. Dentro de la comunidad de trabajo nos enlazan calles y espacios comunes, que al mismo tiempo se entrelaza con otras comunidades de trabajo, no puede funcionar bien en un aislamiento respecto a su entorno.\r\n\r\n\"UN TALLER AUTOGESTIONADO\" Nadie disfruta su trabajo si solamente es un engranaje para una máquina. Todos disfrutamos el trabajo cuando comprendemos la totalidad del mismo y nos hacemos responsables de esa totalidad. El trabajo es una parte de nuestras vidas, con sus propias recompensas, el progreso tecnológico de los últimos años nos ha creado el estilo de obreros que nos vemos obligados a actuar como parte de una máquina, creamos piezas sin consecuencia y no somos responsables del conjunto. Por tanto, creemos en la formación de un taller abierto y de una oficina auto-gestionada, con autonomía, con estilo de trabajo, con relación con otras comunidades y cuando la tarea sea compleja cooperamos con otros grupos para la producción de artefactos y servicios.\r\n","slug":"lagranjafablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/07/31/18/01/35/c0d5767b-f642-4ec7-a053-9dec9cde57c7/La Granja FabLab.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/13/56/26/e24d04b5-7220-4bad-903b-4a40c1b0dda1/La Granja Fab Lab.jpg","address_1":"43 Av. 2-45 zona 8 (Contiguo a la Colonia El Maestro)","address_2":"","city":"Quetzaltenango","county":"Select if Appropriate","postal_code":"09001","country_code":"GT","latitude":14.8670975,"longitude":-91.5474382,"address_notes":"","phone":"+502 34002830","email":"luisfercastillo@hotmail.com","capabilities":["cnc_milling","circuit_production","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":1015,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/LaGranjaFabLab"},{"id":2176,"url":"https://issuu.com/lagranjafab_lab"},{"id":2177,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/lagranja_fablab/"},{"id":2178,"url":"https://vimeo.com/lagranjafablab"}]},{"id":1915,"name":"Megahub ","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":259,"blurb":"Megahub is a multidisciplinary space, made of a 250sqm makerspace and 120sqm coworking, it's able to host medium-long term artisan, designers, professionals and students.","description":"Megahub is founded by a social enterprise which is focused on social issues: youth occupation, refugees and self-entrepreneurship so the target is the weakest part of population but even students and companies.\r\n\r\nMegahub's goal is to provide a safe place to try yourself in order to get new skills, develop new projects or just find out new interests. \r\n\r\nPractically we provide 8 private areas for rent in our workshop and 10 desks in our coworking, furthermore the fablab provide a well equiped wood working corner and carpentry area, a set of 3d printers, a CO2 laser cutter, a cnc milling machine, a metal lathe, a thermoforming machine, a fully equipped electronic bench and a photograpic set.\r\n\r\nTalking about the first floor our customers can take advantage of a cosy coworking space, a wide conference room and a private meeting room. \r\nIn the last 2 years we successfully experienced training programme for unemployed youngs and recently we've broaden our programmes to high-school students. \r\n\r\nWhile for our makers we garantee a 3 afternoons and a saturday morning business time during that they can adoperate tools and equipment always supervised by our capable tutors. \r\n\r\nDuring last years we've been able to draw companies' interests and municipalities' trust as well, this fruitful network allow us to develop complex and effective programmes.","slug":"megahubVI","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/22/22/52/36/bf0204c6-c313-43ba-b3ac-427230733e6a/logo megahub.JPG","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/22/22/52/37/eaeaf3e8-7cb5-434c-86b4-ac5ae62428cf/foto_megahub.jpeg","address_1":"Via Paraiso 60","address_2":"","city":"Schio","county":"Vicenza","postal_code":"36015","country_code":"IT","latitude":45.7095387,"longitude":11.3749731,"address_notes":"Via Paraiso 60, all'interno dei un complesso industriale con altre attività.

Read the description for a deeper understanding of our approach.","description":"This project started in Santiago de Chile during FAB13 from the brains of Marina Villelabeitia and Romain Di Vozzo. Marina is a patagonian Architect and Designer based in Rada Tilly, Comodoro-Rivadavia, Argentina. Romain is an INRIA R\u0026D Engineer, Fablab Director and Artist based in France where he runs Fablab Digiscope, on Le Campus Paris-Saclay. Marina and Romain have decided to team-up (again) to start the Fablab Patagonia Network and the Fablab Comodoro-Rivadavia (from scratch). Marina will lead the development of the network and the fablab locally from Comodoro-Rivadavia and Romain will assist her remotely on every necesary aspect to make this project happen. The idea here is to bring patagonian talents (natives and imported ones) to collaborate on bringing a more sustainable life-style through the valorization of (massive) local wastes from fisheries, as well as introducing new publics - citizens, artisans, students, entrepreneurs, startups, researchers - to design technics and Digital Fabrication Processes. Global Warming has started to create uncommon issues in places like Comodoro-Rivadavia where tons of clay have flowed into the houses following torrential rains. What about creating a distributed patagonian fablab network to 3D print clay, to make fabric out of fish-skins, to experiment with Sheep breeding and the wool and the leathers, to connect this so-called \"End of the World\" area to the rest of the world by offering distributed education programs in Digital Fabrication, in Biology and Fashion Design ? With the proximity of the Chilean Patagonia, transnational collaborations can be set up to contribute to the dynamics with Argentina. This project has a potential. Wanna join ?

Also, a lot of young people pass through this area which helps the lab in terms of standing out. On top of that, we believe that the surrounding atmosphere which is very formal and fast-paced will inspire those who come to our lab to be more productive and efficient. \r\nThe tools and machinery that we have are 130W laser cutter/engraver, Ultimaker 3 Extended, Roland SRM 20, Roland GS24 and other small-scale tools such as power drill, power angle grinder, soldering station, and others. In terms of tools, it is safe to say that we only come second to some major academic institutions of Mongolia. That being said since our country has declared its democracy most of Mongolia has been completely devoid of the maker culture, let alone Fab Lab. Even our engineering society has reached rock bottom. People in our country have stopped being interested in science anymore. Hence, we set out to change this and we decided to create the very first Fab Lab of Mongolia.

We share Technology within the \"Open Source\" culture by mentoring, training, making, and researching activities. Our main theme is \"Digital Fabrication\" which is the procedure of converting \"ideas\" into \"tangible objects\" through the digital 3D designing and digital manufacturing CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/ Computer-Aided Manufacturing). Moreover, we do Arduino-related projects (electronics, programming, and software). In addition to the \"hand skills\" in different materials, such as wood, polymers, and metal, in fine and digital art, the human artistic field, and recycling.\r\nThe local community in Basra and all over Iraq (of entrepreneurs, STEM enthusiasts, and private sector, innovators, developers, artists) is an essential component of our supporting team that gives us the energy to keep up what we’re doing.

In 2015 we created one of the very first rural FabLabs in Portugal, and together with it, one of the first residency programs within a fablab in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 another house was added to Buinho, to provide more space for the residents.Both the fablab and residency house of São Joao are traditional adobe house, located in the historic quarters of Messejana. Originally built in 19th century, they are now completely remodeled, offering wide-open studios, access to the equipment and tools, as well as an intimate and familiar environment. The two houses together can accommodate up to 6 people in single and double bedrooms. Our vision is to build a network of creative spaces in the historic town Messejana, always available to our members and residents. Those spaces will complement each other and offer diverse possibilities of collaboration and experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is equipped with two CNC mill, two laser cutters, multiple 3d printers, and various tools and machines for traditional woodwork.

This population is often ignored and denied access to many aspects of community life. Recently, the U.S. federal government mandated that individuals with disabilities receiving government-funded services must be fully integrated and involved in the community. WLS realized that a Fab Lab provides a unique opportunity for community inclusion for the IDDA population. \r\n\r\nA Fab Lab gives people with disabilities access to inclusive public spaces along with community-integrated training in digital fabrication. Just as elementary school students can learn to operate digital fabrication equipment, so too can individuals with IDDA, if given the proper training, support, and supervision. \r\n\r\nWLS believes the IDDA population can benefit from working in a public Fab Lab environment where training classes are integrated and where creativity is emphasized. WLS hopes that by realizing their creativity and by developing the skills to digitally fabricate products, higher-functioning individuals with IDDA could possibly join the community workforce or want to produce items for retail sale.\r\n\r\nWLS will house The Valley Fab Lab within a local makerspace being developed by our Chamber of Commerce, The City of Sharon, a non-profit veterans’ support organization, our local Urban League, and an area artists’ group. These affiliations guarantee our Fab Lab will have a publicly accessible location as well as opportunities for artists-in-residence projects; administrative, financial, marketing, and business-development support; and patronage and assistance from leaders in our community.   \r\n\r\nAfter meeting several times with Jon Doctorick, Technical and Education Manager of Fab Lab Carnegie Science Center, Pittsburgh, PA, we identified the equipment best suited for our individuals but still relevant for the general public. This equipment has been ordered but not yet received; therefore, our Fab Lab is not expected to be operational until after we receive the equipment and our Fab Lab staff have been trained. We have enlisted Fab Lab Carnegie Science Center to train our staff in early 2020.\r\n\r\nOnce we have set up The Valley Fab Lab and staff have been trained on the digital fabrication equipment, we will provide training classes to the general public as well as offer the use of our Fab Lab equipment for designing and producing items. We hope to share with and learn from the Fab Lab network, especially with regard to the pedagogy for less complex fabrications and for individuals with learning disabilities. While we are aware that many elementary schools have functioning Fab Labs, we are unaware of any Fab Lab focused on working with people with IDDA in a fully inclusive and public setting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"thevalleyfablab","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"200 Sterling Avenue","address_2":"","city":"Sharon","county":"Pennsylvania","postal_code":"16146","country_code":"US","latitude":41.234691,"longitude":-80.505376,"address_notes":"The Valley Fab Lab is located in the Laurel Technical Institute (LTI) Sharon building.

Rather than focus on individual tools in the lab, we try as often as possible to synthesize the use of multiple tools to create actionable solutions.  We are process and progress oriented, and have successfully created a culture where idea doubt has been separated from self-doubt, and all learners in the lab, students and teachers, reframe challenges to be opportunities to learn and reiterate.  \r\n\r\nWe have two student-run businesses running our of our lab: Lightning Orthotics, a student-run business 3D printing help, and Sweet Victory: Ice Cream for Social Change.  Lightning Orthotics has run for two years, using our 3D software and printers to have students take action in their ongoing iteration process to build tools to help the everyday lives of people needing additional assistance with their hands.  They have successfully made it to market after continuous testing and reiteration with patients.  Sweet Victory has students using design thinking and their capacity for creative thinking to ideate and iterate ice cream flavors.  With each scoop the customers get to vote on three different local organizations to help decide where the proceeds will be used.  Each month one organization is chosen, and the proceeds are used to help students use the eLab tools to help create solutions for the organization.  For instance, our Sweet Victory students designed and vinyl cut Summer take home bags for The Passage 423, a local organization run by teachers.\r\n\r\nThe lab is also used to connect with content area classrooms, and allows students to drive mastery by making.  Students have used the lab to test their physics knowledge rapidly iterating balloon-powered race cars, or creating scaled models of tiny-homes in their math classes.  Language Arts classes have used the tools to demonstrate abstract themes in their novels, and help audiences visualize their informational and argumentative ideas by creating 3D representations of objects or ideas.\r\n","slug":"npmmvwelab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/07/09/15/35/03/11c98c2a-9632-4249-a9f4-785dde761e74/Normal Park sm. logo.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/07/09/15/35/03/b84ff2a8-853c-4b05-86e9-8c100f6158f2/VW-header-cropped.jpg","address_1":"1219 W Mississippi Ave","address_2":"","city":"Chattanooga","county":"","postal_code":"37405","country_code":"US","latitude":35.0767703,"longitude":-85.3015843,"address_notes":"","phone":"423.498.6880","email":"willmore_c@hcde.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[]},{"id":2225,"name":"FabLab Materia","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"La búsqueda por integrar nuevas tecnologías, materiales y maquinaria, será pieza clave y fundamental del FabLab Materia.

In China, Fab Lab Wuhan has another name called “The Micro-Innovation Lab of the Optical valley” which proved the big influence from it to the local innovation needs. From the beginning of this lab, we have set up the goal to achieve:  build up a service system to help the innovators and makers during the whole process from inspiration to Prototype, deploy the concept, knowledge and skills of digital manufacturing, make innovation easier to more people. \r\n\r\nFor Innovation Service:  Now, Fab Lab Wuhan is a real agglomeration of intelligent equipment, networking, field of set Exchange, sharing, practice, testing and commercial operation. We also cooperate with local angel investment to help students optimize their production for commercial purpose. The total area of Fab Lab Wuhan is more than 400 square meter, half of the space is for equipment, including a GCC laser cutter, 3D printer, Rolland SRM-20 CNC, vinyl cutter, CNC milling machine, 3D scanner etc. The other half is the workshop space. The lab is fully open to the public. We provide free basic material for testing purpose. In every Saturday, there will be a salon or lecture of ideas collision and learning. Normally the topic is no limited, technical, trend analysis, commercial and any others. The speaker is mainly someone who has expertise and skills to share. So far we have 14 innovation teams working in our lab.\r\n\r\nFor Research:  Fab lab Wuhan works with professors from school of mechanical engineering, electronic and Materials science, etc. The on-going project include: Upgrading the desktop level 3D printer to the industrial-grade 3D printer for lab use with professor Li from school of mechanical engineering and developing a glass cleaning robot with a local company. Fab lab also plays the role as the second innovation center for local companies. Now we have set up the fab research center in HUST Qiming College, working on the fab 2.0 solution to make some new machines based on the local lab and company’s needs. \r\nFor Education: Supported by the HUST, Fab lab Wuhan is working on how to deploy the concept of digital manufacturing to more students in university. We already participate the fab academy in 2016 and then deploy the fab related courses in local school. We also deploy the stem education methods through the fab lab system in local middle and high school, introducing to teenagers of maker space, maker movement concept.\r\n\r\nBase on the support of HUST and Optical Valley, Fab Lab Wuhan has got a big platform to deploy innovation in different way. This will be very meaningful to our school also to the city. We love fab lab.\r\n","slug":"fabwuhan","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/28/13/faf01b4d-c3e3-4440-b7a7-284ec38bb499/Fablab Wuhan.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/47/48/1ca33d2b-b5b3-4a3f-bfd9-37c559368ae4/Fablab Wuhan.jpg","address_1":"HUST Science Park Innovation Base Building No.2","address_2":"","city":"武汉","county":"HuBei","postal_code":"430223","country_code":"CN","latitude":30.4449814554706,"longitude":114.39577530423,"address_notes":"HUST Science Park Innovation Base Building No.2","phone":"+8613429881722","email":"249486274@qq.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":1794,"url":"http://www.i-microlab.com"}]},{"id":2043,"name":"FabLab Hamm Westfalen","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"","description":"","slug":"hamm","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/30/16/13/27/e17e455b-1e12-4699-8e54-7a4ee2786718/FAB LAB.jpeg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/06/30/16/13/27/ebc7a7cf-49fe-4109-9a48-643fd682192c/FabLab_LogoHamm1.png","address_1":"Banningstraße 15","address_2":"","city":"Hamm","county":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","postal_code":"59067","country_code":"DE","latitude":51.6722925,"longitude":7.80712889999995,"address_notes":"2.

It was selected among several other institutions to receive a grant from the U.S. Department of State in 2014 to pilot an education initiative aimed at mastering critical multiple literacies that youth need to succeed in life. By embracing the notion that information is everywhere, and therefore, learning opportunities are everywhere, CTJ, in close coordination with the U.S. Embassy, is working on a new educational approach. The idea is to create a maker culture in the institution as a whole and share our learning path with the Brazilian BNCs network, and other educators in our community. Besides English, students should understand also the concepts of entrepreneurship, leadership, digital literacy (21st Century skills). With the main goal of offering a different way of learning what is seen in theory, putting into practice what is in the world of ideas and encouraging everyone to explore new technologies, Thomas Maker, located at our Asa Norte Branch in Brasília (DF) makes its space available to the community of doers and offers workshops and courses organized by the CTJ team and partners. Opened in August 2016, the project offers a broad, vibrant and inclusive learning environment.

During eLab related arts classes, students create solutions to address real-world challenges in business, engineering, and design. Academic subject area classrooms frequently utilize the VW eLab to extend learning beyond the typical classroom and integrate digital fabrication into academic mPBL’s. Students learn entrepreneurial and digital design skills by managing a t-shirt design and manufacturing business, marketing to peers, faculty, sports teams, and local customers. After school, the VW eLab becomes a makerspace, where students remain engaged in group and individualized learning environments. We offer several after-school opportunities throughout the year, including a student-run business, an electric race car team, student-parent digital learning opportunities, and robotics (new this year). In addition to classroom and small group sessions, VW eLab student projects and advanced digital fabrication tutoring sessions address the educational needs of individual students. By implementing this multi-use model, the Dalewood Middle School VW eLab provides diverse learning and “making” opportunities to empower students with critical life skills in problem-solving, collaboration, leadership, and the application of academic core content.","slug":"dalewoodvewlab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/14/16/44/38/b030d359-4496-461c-849a-9dd63c7a3849/Blue Knight 6x4 blue white black png.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/01/14/16/44/38/53e410e1-0900-411a-ab2d-53f252d20b86/Lab 1.jpg","address_1":"1300 Shallowford Rd","address_2":"","city":"Chattanooga","county":"TN","postal_code":"37405","country_code":"US","latitude":35.0402317382647,"longitude":-85.2218588650818,"address_notes":"The VW eLab at Dalewood Middle School is located in Dalewood Middle School.

Since then, he has been living in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing where he was absorbed by both his fascination for China and his passion for new inventions. A great enthusiast of new technology, Sebastien decides to settle down again in Beijing with his wife and two children in 2015.  For ten years, he has been working within a big international Engineering company (Areva), from numerical simulation to engineering team leader. He is the co-founder of Atelier + FabLab in Beijing in 2016.\r\n\r\nMarianne Daquet Directrice et founder of ATELIER ART SCHOOL\r\nAfter graduating from two French Fine Art Schools, Marianne, became a promising artist and began to teach art in different schools located in disadvantaged neighborhoods to kids from primary to high school. After meeting a French man who had already been in Beijing for several years, she joined him in 2006 and developed a small art school in the hutong. After the birth of her two daughters, she began to experience this strong feeling that she would stay in Beijing for a while. The project that she matured for years was ready to get launched: she opened Atelier Art School in September 2012. Since then Atelier has grown in a comprehensive art educational project that she leads this with passion, a curious and open mind and creativity. Passing on her passion for Art studies has become her life’s purpose.\r\n\r\nAdeline Parrot Directrice of the studies and operations at atelier art school\r\nAdeline graduated from one of the most famous French Fine Art School : La villa Arson in Nice. During her studies she experimented painting and sculpture and passed her exam highly commended. She came in China for the first time in 2011 and stayed in Beijing for a year, her artwork enriched himself with all the materials and objects she used to glean in the various and colourful markets of the city. She taught several workshops at Atelier this year and opened the way to an ambitious view of Art Education. She went back in Paris for an artist residency, participated in several exhibitions but her curiosity for China pushed her to come back to Beijing in 2014. She began to teach full time art classes at Atelier, since then, Adeline became Atelier’s most famous teacher, she quickly brung her own touch to Atelier’s course content and is now and director of the studies and operations.\r\n\r\nThe Space\r\nAtelier Fablab has a space of 100m2 located in Beijing Chaoyang district.  The setting up is divided in two separate rooms: A big principal room of around 50m2 dedicated to the workshops and courses. A second room with producing machine tools, computers and common work space.\r\nThis collaborative space is designed to facilitate exchanges and make possible the creation of projects or meetings. The space is friendly, open, bright. The Ecological footprint is reduced to a minimum in accordance with environmental responsibility which is one the core value of Atelier FabLab.

Friesland is a rural province in the northern part of the Netherlands and FryskLab, housed in a library truck, is Europe’s first official library FabLab. It has a team with a very diverse background, ranging from IT, arts management and library service management. The goal of Fers is to explore how a mobile FabLab contributes to the creative, technical and entrepreneurial skills development of children and young people. In the end the project should contribute to an increase in the innovative capacities of the province of Friesland as a whole.\r\n \r\nThe motto of the FryskLab project isn’t without reason knowledge-making and sharing of the future. The role of the library is that of facilitator, both in terms of physical capabilities (machines, tools, etc.), but also in the development of training and support. The principle here is that we look at FabLabs and makerspaces as the place where physical and digital use and knowledge-sharing converge. After all, users have the obligation to document their projects, after which they become available to others. In this development Fers is a Dutch and European frontrunner.\r\n \r\nThe FryskLab project was officially started in January 2014, after noticing that, especially in the US, libraries started to see the potential of working together with FabLabs and makerspaces or creating their own. The team at Fers received space and time to see if it could bring this development to the rural province of Fryslân. FryskLab uses the FabLab environment to bring 21st Century Skills to primary and secondary education. With a dedicated educational program the project tries to tackle specific local challenges. \r\n \r\nThe FryskLab truck\r\nFryskLab is accommodated in a truck that formerly served as a traditional book mobile. The dimensions of the truck are 10.33 x 2.55 x 3.85 (LxWxH in meters) and the truck weighs 13.000 kg’s. FryskLab is mainly driven by two retired book mobile drivers. The FryskLab truck can comfortably host groups of 10-12 adults or 15-20 children/teenagers. If the weather is nice it is also possible to set up an open-air working environment outside of the truck. This has been done numerous times and is always an huge success. People are attracted by the new technology and playful setting in which they can tinker and experiment. It is also perfectly possible to bring working equipment inside schools or libraries to create an inhouse workshop environment. Since the truck has everything on hand it is easy to bring tools and equipment inside.\r\n \r\nThe mobile FabLab is first of all equipped with digital fabrication tools: 3D printers (Ultimaker Classic, six Ultimaker 2 Go’s, Builder and Up Plus) and a 3D scanner, laser cutter, vinyl cutter, 3Doodler pen and assorted hand tools. For designing-, documentation- and programming purposes we bring ten Macbook Airs and fifteen Dell laptops, plus an Apple TV to give presentations with. We use open source computer boards such as MaKey MaKeys and Arduinos and introduce visitors and students to electronics with littleBits kits. Strawbees are used to protope with 3D design using straws (bought cheaply from IKEA) and laser cutted connection parts. We use a wide variety of software including Scratch, Doodle3D, Cura, Repetier, 123Design, Inkscape, Photoshop Elements, Tinkercad, SketchUp Make, Sculptris, and Mozilla Webmaker. FryskLab features it’s own 4G networking router, which makes it possible to connect to the Internet almost anywhere. The truck also has a set up battery-packs with which it can run stand-alone for a maximum of four hours. When electricity is available 220 volts is sufficient to power all the necessary machines and lighting and heating.\r\n \r\nAan Kootstra works at Fers as a Digital Domain Specialist, and is the lab manager of FryskLab. “With our mobile lab,” he explained, “we want to contribute to the innovative capacity of the province. Technology will play an increasingly important role in our society. With the democratization of technology machines are becoming more affordable and in affordable range of citizens. Libraries can play a major role in familiarizing citizens with this technology.”\r\n \r\nAt the moment Fers is in talks with a large number of educational institutions (from primary schools to university level) to realize three so-called life-long digital fabrication learning courses based on the aforementioned themes. The result should be a high potential of skilled young talents for local companies which will benefit the local economic development that is lacking in qualified staff. This dedicated local focus is necessary to realize a sustainable (library-related) FabLab. Often we see examples of libraries setting up labs which are little more than a display for 3D printers and related machines. We however think the potential for digital fabrication in relation to libraries is much higher than just that. It’s about, quoting David Lankes:“the mission of librarians to improve society through facilitating knowledge creation in their communities”.\r\n\r\nTimeline / Going places\r\n\r\nJanuary 2014: official start of the project\r\nApril 2014: project manager Jeroen de Boer talked about the project in Roskilde (Danmark) at the library conference Make of Die!, organised by Centralbibliothek. Via Skype he presented at Computers in Libraries (Hack the Library!). \r\nMay 2014: FryskLab drove to Aarhus (again Danmark) to be part of the Mini Maker Faire and hosting sessions especially for Danish library-colleagues. \r\nNovember 2014: The core members of the FryskLab team received a Dutch library innovation award, the BibliotheekInitiatiefPrijs. In the same year the project was also shortlisted for another Dutch innovation award for the information-technology sector, the IVI Award.\r\nFebruary 2015: FryskLab went on an European road trip, the MakerTour2015, which led the mobile lab to the OCLC EMEARC Meeting in Florence and back. During this trip the team visited twelve (library) FabLabs in eight countries. In these FabLabs sessions were put together on the fly to find solutions for the visually impaired. The main goal of these sessions was to work out a prototype we had designed: an audio poster, powered by an Arduino computer. Our secondary goal during this trip was to convey the idea of the joining of libraries and the maker philosophy.\r\nDecember 2015: FryskLab wins the Mediawijzer.net Stimulerings Award.\r\nJanuari 2016: Publication of Makerspaces in Libraries, written by Theresa Willingham and FryskLab project manager Jeroen de Boer. \r\nFebruari 2016: FryskLab wins IPON Award 2016 with the project Platform Maker Education.\r\nOctober 2016: FryskLab produces ten library maker boxes, handed over in Brussels to members of European Parliament to celebrate the role of public libraries in coding and digital literacies.\r\nJune 2017: The American Library Association (ALA) awarded FryskLab as one of three winners of the \"Presidential Citation for Innovative International Library Projects”. With the citation the IRRT (International Relations Round Table) Advisory Award Committee of the ALA recognizes FryskLab as innovative, unique and an inspiration for libraries worldwide. \"That the largest library association in the world grants us this award is a great honor,\" said project manager Jeroen de Boer. \"For us mentioning the importance of maker spaces in libraries by the ALA in 2014 was one of the most important motivations to start with FryskLab.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://www.frysklab.nl \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/frysklab \r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/83026924@N03/albums \r\n\r\nContact: Jeroen de Boer jeroen@fers.nl 0031(0)582847743 \r\n","slug":"frysklab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/16/15/12408a36-96ac-4185-9b02-abaf6b7b1476/FryskLab.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/09/25/12/46/03/c048a2a7-6ee3-4ee9-b325-322ddd07e28c/29662023357_66a37022bd_k.jpg","address_1":"Zuiderkruisweg 4","address_2":"","city":"Leeuwarden","county":"Fryslân","postal_code":"8938 AP","country_code":"NL","latitude":53.1935083,"longitude":5.84536500000002,"address_notes":"","phone":"31582847743","email":"jeroen@fers.nl","capabilities":["three_d_printing","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":7688,"url":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/83026924@N03/albums"},{"id":7652,"url":"http://twitter.com/frysklab"},{"id":7651,"url":"http://facebook.com/frysklab"},{"id":710,"url":"http://www.frysklab.nl"}]},{"id":1407,"name":"Fab Lab Siam","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"FabLab Siam is a non-profit organization aiming to develop and mentor makers \u0026 innovators in the community.

Mission-Design. Create. Fabricate. The Northwood Fab Lab is an essential facility with fee access for both the school district and the wider community.","description":"Northwood Fab Lab\r\nVision-Making ideas a reality.\r\nMission-Design. Create. Fabricate.\r\n\r\nThe Northwood District (Minong, Gordon, Wascott and Frog Creek) spreads across more than 400 square miles of small, rural, non-farm communities. Lake homes in the area contribute to a unique circumstance of a property rich community, despite significant poverty among many families. Parents of many of our students earn low wages (median family income is 20% less than the state average). Because we are property rich, the district only receives a total of $22,000 in general state aid, 5th lowest in the state - while surrounding districts receive approximately $6,000 per student. \r\n\r\nNorthwood School District unveiled their new fabrication laboratory (Fab Lab) on Thursday, October 6, 2016. A Fab Lab is a small-scale prototyping facility offering opportunities for students and community to try digital fabrication for free. The main focus of the Fab Lab is educating students, through hands-on experiences, allowing them to put into practice concepts they have learned in science, technology, engineering, art/design, and mathematics (STEAM) courses.  Examples of student projects: \r\n\r\nRevitalizing the community garden\r\nBuilding indoor elementary planting racks\r\nConstructing physical therapy devices for local company\r\nBridge Engineering challenge \r\nDesigning outdoor signs for businesses \u0026 school\r\nCustom rocketry (3D printed nose cones \u0026 fins)\r\nFabricated furniture for classrooms - “Quiet Spaces”  ($900 in savings)\r\nStudent run enterprises\r\nGirls-In-Engineering: 3D printed scale houses \u0026 hovercrafts\r\n\r\nFab Labs (started by MIT) share core capabilities, allowing people to share projects and ideas across a global network. These labs are generally setup with similar computer controlled equipment where participants will have the opportunity to literally make almost anything. The Northwood Fab Lab has a laser engraver, vinyl cutter, six 3D printers, mini-milling machine, 4’x8’ CNC router, soldering, welding and woodworking equipment, and laptops.  \r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab will always allow free community access (many others charge). For the first year of operation the Northwood Fab Lab was open twice a month from 4pm-8pm.  Users bring their own material; training and equipment are all provided to meet individual goals.  A typical evening averages 12 individuals (mostly adults), but we have had 24 in one session.  As we begin this next school year we plan to be open weekly from 4pm-8pm for free community access.  Community projects have ranged from personal, gifts, business, etc. Community nights will continue through the summer and hopefully be scheduled weekly next fall. Additional weekend and summer workshops are in development as well. The Fab Lab advisory board consists of school administrators, teachers, community, and business representatives.  Our Fab Lab Board meets regularly, and handles the challenges that arise.\r\n\r\nIt is important that our students are provided the same opportunities that are available in large school districts. They need access to current technology and equipment, and funding is our biggest challenge. The Fab Lab provides us with countless opportunities to engage and inspire our students to look beyond the borders of northern Wisconsin. Community access allows everyone within driving distance to also share in this success and global economy.  The location of where someone lives, or the financial situation they are in, shouldn’t limit how far they go or what they achieve.","slug":"northwoodfablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/01/04/23/30/06/90f00661-6602-4c89-9039-30e18c7f9334/FABlogo.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/01/04/23/37/06/c795afc0-1816-4d7e-ba4d-e4f27b7a0630/fab lab sign.jpg","address_1":"N14463 S Hwy 53","address_2":"","city":"Minong","county":"Wisconsin","postal_code":"54859","country_code":"US","latitude":46.1567145,"longitude":-91.8135342,"address_notes":"The Fab Lab exterior entrance can be accessed outside the shop which is located between door 17 and the auditorium entrance.","phone":"715-466-2297","email":"benjamin_sorensen@northwoodk12wi.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":4893,"url":"https://sites.google.com/site/northwoodfablab/home"},{"id":4894,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/northwoodfablab/"}]},{"id":596,"name":"FABLAB-CHENE20","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"FABLAB-CHENE20 is open to all who want to work together.

Pour un nouveau projet qui demande de réaliser un prototype, on peut trouver des documents ou des vidéos sur chaque sujet technique et chaque procédé de fabrication. Encore faut-il savoir que ce procédé existe, qu'il est avantageux pour notre besoin, et parler à quelqu'un qui l'a expérimenté. C'est là où PolyFab se démarque. Non seulement, PolyFab donnent accès à des machines, mais PolyFab constitue avant tout une communauté d’intérêts. \r\n\r\nPourquoi une communauté d’intérêt? En fait, PolyFab évolue dans un esprit communautaire où les membres s’inscrivent de manière volontaire, par intérêt. Il s'agit d'un endroit où les passionnées de projets, de toutes disciplines et expertises se rencontrent et échangent. Un endroit neutre qui rassemble tous les génies, un lieu qui favorise l’approche par projets, l’apprentissage par les pairs, l’apprentissage actif. \r\n\r\nC’est bien beau tout ça, mais comment ça fonctionne ? En fait, les ingrédients sont des machines très flexibles, des vidéos sur leur utilisation, un parcours simple pour valider ses connaissances, et finalement un lieu où les membres se rassemblent, échangent et apprennent les uns des autres.  \r\n\r\nLe PolyFab a ouvert ses portes en septembre 2016, et a déjà accueilli près de 300 membres dans ses 1000 pieds carré. PolyFab compte sur une équipe d’une douzaine d’étudiants-animateur, mais PolyFab doit surtout son succès à son équipe de bénévoles passionnés qui se rencontrent toutes les semaines pour discuter des enjeux et des projets à venir. Le PolyFab, c’est un espace de création où il est possible de libérer sa créativité grâce aux possibilités de la fabrication numérique et additive.  \r\n\r\n//\r\n\r\nPolyFab is based on the makers’ desire to be able to make (almost) anything. If you want to build a prototype for a new project, it is possible to find all the documentation, the technical specification and processes to follow on the web. However, it is hard to look for a process that you might not know existed nor that it might be suited to your needs, or to find someone who has used it before to discuss with. This is where the PolyFab stands out. Nonetheless, PolyFab grants its members access to a large variety of equipment, but PolyFab as its roots in a community of interest.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because PolyFab evolves with its members forming a community that is driven by a common interest. This place gathers project enthusiasts from different backgrounds, and constitutes a middle ground that brings together various specialities.\r\n\r\nSounds great, but how does it work? The main ingredients are a wide variety of equipment, tutorial videos that explain how to properly use them, a simple path to validate how to use of the equipment and, finally, a place where people gather, discuss and learn from each other.\r\n\r\nPolyFab is operating since September 2016 and already counts 300 members. The PolyFab staff is composed of 12 employees from the student community of the Polytechnique Montréal, but mainly owes its success to its group of passionate volunteers who meet to discuss several issues and projects. PolyFab is a creative space where it is possible to release one’s creativity by the use of digital fabrication","slug":"polyfab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/05/24/15/36/37/46a774b9-ef3d-4ffa-ad4c-46481b6e192d/PolyFab-white.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/05/24/15/36/37/9441c297-c139-44d6-ba84-2c48e3fde433/RIE-10.jpg","address_1":"Pavillons Pierre-Lassonde et Claudette McKay-Lassonde","address_2":"","city":"Montreal","county":"","postal_code":"H3T 1J4","country_code":"CA","latitude":45.5047412,"longitude":-73.6147506,"address_notes":"L-3812.1c","phone":"514 340-4711 #2233","email":"polyfab@nova.polymtl.ca","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":4702,"url":"http://polyfab.polymtl.ca/wiki/ "},{"id":4703,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/MtlPolyFab/"},{"id":4704,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwv-bRLR0K4u-p7sfFg-GOA"}]},{"id":66,"name":"\"Experimentarium1502 MPEI\" (Fab Lab)","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Created especially for high school students.

In FabLab Zeeland kun je met behulp van moderne computergestuurde ‘maakmachines’ zoals 3D-printers, lasersnijder, vinylsnijder en ontwerpsoftware zelf dingen (leren) maken die voorheen alleen door megaconcerns konden worden gerealiseerd. \r\n\r\nDeze informele leer- werkplaats biedt iedereen de kans en ruimte om samen op lokaal, nationaal en internationaal niveau aan nieuwe ideeën, experimenten en uitvindingen te werken. Opgedane kennis en vaardigheden worden gedeeld met iedereen. Zo wordt de afstand van “idee naar product” kleiner. Loop je al een tijd met een idee rond maar je weet niet hoe je deze kunt vormgeven? Dan ben je in FabLab Zeeland aan het juiste adres.\r\n\r\nDe werkwijze is gebaseerd op het FabLab concept, zoals dat bedacht is door Neil Gershenfeld, directeur van het Centre of Bits and ATOMs (CBA) aan het Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Wereldwijd zijn er meer dan 360 FabLabs operationeel die via een uniek internationaal netwerk met elkaar zijn verbonden. In Nederland zijn er ruim 38 FabLabs. \r\n\r\nKijk voor meer informatie over fablabs op de website van stichting FabLab Benelux: www.fablab.nl\r\n\r\nWaar vind je ons?\r\nFabLab Zeeland is gevestigd in ons gebouw aan de Kousteensedijk in Middelburg. Naast het exploiteren van een vast lab binnen de muren van de ZB wordt, in samenwerking met Frysklab (het mobiele FabLab van Friesland), de onderwijsbus Columbus ingericht met een tweetal 3D printers. De mediacoaches van de Columbus brengen het ‘maakonderwijs’ onder de aandacht bij een aantal pilotscholen binnen het basisonderwijs. Een ingerichte FabLabbus kan op termijn een belangrijke rol gaan vervullen in de regio.\r\n\r\nSamen met HZ University of Applied Sciences, Dok 41, Scalda, Stichting ZigZag, Provincie Zeeland en Protospace Utrecht wordt onderzocht of er op termijn een groter FabLab op de kenniswerf in Vlissingen gevestigd kan worden. \r\n\r\nMeer weten?\r\nWil je meer informatie over FabLab Zeeland?

The fab lab is located at school, so our main audience is high school and university students.","slug":"hangar159","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/27/14/28/22/c0fddcdf-a3e3-4c53-9f78-a9ee7fd0553d/logo.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/04/27/14/28/22/60c886cb-1f51-4667-acaa-4bac843f31f6/awawaw.jpg","address_1":"вулиця Генерала Тупікова, 22","address_2":"","city":"Київ","county":"Kyiv","postal_code":"02000","country_code":"UA","latitude":50.4411999506941,"longitude":30.4397475178604,"address_notes":"Entrance is near big spruce (Christmas tree) at the backyard of the school #159\r\n ","phone":"+380639548520","email":"xenashelev@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"corona","links":[{"id":10468,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/hangar159fablab"}]},{"id":2236,"name":"Fab Lab UCY","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":27,"blurb":"Provide scientifically documented knowledge and technically sound solutions in the field of digital design and fabrication that can benefit the broader global community.","description":"Τhe UCY Fab Lab has as one of its main goals the transfer and dissemination of scientifically shared knowledge and technically sound solutions under the guidance of specialized academic and technical staff in the broader global community. This is achieved through the provision of specialized knowledge and skills for the conception and development of ideas, the design and modeling as well as the production of physical prototypes as well as the implementation and control of specific processes with priority being the logic of mass customization and the democratization of the manufacturing process. Specifically, academics with specialized experience and knowledge in computational design and digital fabrication are acting as mentors and can advise, guide and assist anyone who has an idea and he/she wishes to implement it using Lab tools. Within this framework, the Lab provides special courses, workshops and individual tutorials that focus on design development and production. In the same vein, the knowledge and experience of Lab technicians in the use of machines (CNC routers, laser cutters, 3D printers, etc.) assist and effectively contribute towards implementation of each proposed idea and methodology in order to achieve its goals and objectives. \r\nIn addition to the knowledge and advices by the people who make up the Lab, the contribution of the tools and mechanisms provided to achieve each goal is equally important. Thus, in addition to the knowledge that is transmitted through the laboratory staff, existing Lab machines or those planned to be acquired in the future can be used for a large number of prototype production processes at different scales. Existing machines such as the laser cutter (TROTEC Professional), the CNC router (custom made), the CNC foam cutter (Hot Wire Systems), the 3D printers (2XUltimaker 2, Felix 3L and Makerbot), the vinyl cutter (Vinyl), the industrial robot (ABB 2600) and the electronics for prototyping circuits and programming microcontrollers (National Instruments and Arduino), as well as the future planned purchases of 3D printers and high precision milling machines can provide enhanced production and processing capabilities. Also, tools and mechanisms as well as workplaces such as those related to material processing and in particular wood works, metal and aluminum works, concrete, clay and gypsum works, are complementary to the process of developing and exploring prototypes and methodologies.\r\nThese two pillars of expertise, both of the specialized staff and of the tools and machines of the UCY Fab Lab, are instrumental in achieving the goals of the workshop that are not only knowledge-transferring and expertise but also the provision of tools and processes to the production and development of ideas that benefit the broader local and global community. Extroversion and networking with other laboratories are among the priorities of the Lab, which have been started and will continue to be implemented though various visits to similar laboratories and companies of specialized engineers abroad to gain further knowledge, expertise and exchange of ideas as well as know-how, but also for training and implementation of products. In the above ways, the UCY Fab Lab hopes to contribute decisively in achieving its goals as a Fab Lab open to the broader global community.\r\n","slug":"fablabucy","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"Ledras 68","address_2":"","city":"Nicosia","county":"Cyprus","postal_code":"1010","country_code":"CY","latitude":35.1740495,"longitude":33.3613559,"address_notes":"","phone":"+22895156","email":"vessiari@ucy.ac.cy","capabilities":["three_d_printing","circuit_production","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[]},{"id":1755,"name":"LabPro CIDET","kind_name":"mini_fab_lab","parent_id":1336,"blurb":"LabPro es una platafroma compuesta por equipos, herramientas, metodologías y profesionales, dedicados a acelerar la incorporación de nueva tecnología en los productos fabricados en Colombia.","description":"LabPro cuenta con maquinaria especializada en fabricación de prototipo rápido 3D, como fresadora de 4 ejes, impresora 3D, cortadora láser y escáner 3D.

Our Fab Lab community is made up of people from the ages of 5 to 75 and at the moment we have more than 100 members. \r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab originally started from an idea in 2014 and officially opened in 2017. Since then, many things have happened. \r\nOur Fab Lab is located in the hospital in the historical center of Moulins that was under construction at the time and we were given a space that was going to be destroyed. \r\nIn addition to our Fab Lab, there are also other associations which are working together with the hospital helping patients with special needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCEPT\r\nIn between local and global \r\nWe are a Fab Lab open to everybody encouraging them to learn, make and share. We are not only a place where you can make almost anything, we are also involved in the French Fablab Network and we are part of the European Initiative “Vulca Makers Mobility”. We participate every year in many makers events. We organized the 1st French Fab Lab meeting and the 1st Vulca seminar in Moulins, both in 2017. \r\nWe have made creating a network one of our main priorities through the makers movement.\r\n\r\nIn between technical skills and soft skills \r\nAt our Fab Lab we have 3D Printers, a laser cutter, a sewing machine, a vinyl cutter, a virtual reality headset, electronics and a multi-skills community which is involved in many different projects. \r\n\r\nWe organize differents events like Seminars, Carnival, small appliance repair, and so on.\r\nWe also send abroad and host international makers (with Vulca). This way, we get the chance to improve our soft skills and meet very interesting, creative people.

The City provides access to the GOCAT for the University and R-7 for purposes of conducting activities associated with the educational and training courses and programs for the purpose of workforce development; the GOCAT Fab Lab is a manifestation of this purpose. The partnership between the University and R-7 provides shared governance of the institutions, both academically and administratively. The creative machinery is provided by each institution with educators and equipment working together to forge new knowledge in the minds of all who walk through the GOCAT doors. With 2 classrooms, a computer lab, community room, conference room, and office space, the environment is designed to provide a great opportunity for learning. To encourage manufacturing skill development, the 7,002 sq.ft. machine shop of the GOCAT houses the R-7 industrial grade manufacturing equipment consisting of multiple manual and CNC milling machines, lathes, grinders and welders. To provide a space where people can make (almost) anything, the 2,044 sq.ft. fab lab houses the University industrial trainers as well as the equipment and inventory required to be an official fab lab.

The Labs are affiliated to the International School of Design and Architecture of the University of Turabo and the International Design Center in Puerto Rico. The distance between each lab is fairly close and accessible to any member or user. The FabLab Puerto Rico has four basic functions;\r\n\r\n1.\tSchool's formal lab and more -- FabLab Puerto Rico is the International School of Design and Architecture Lab. We work with our design students in Fashion, Industrial, Interior, Graphic Design and Architecture. We collaborate with artists and designers from all communities in Puerto Rico to promote experimentation and innovation.\r\n\r\n2.\tOpen FabLab -- We have an active collaborative program with educational and community-based projects and institutions working with them at no charge. We are working with public museums, preservation institutions; community based initiatives, schools and cultural preservation projects. It’s a constant initiative that extends the use of the lab facility as we use the school students, professors and volunteers. A short proposal is required.\r\n\r\n3.\tPrototyping and R\u0026D for the IDC -- The International Design Center promotes design development and innovation for all local industries. We offer a variety of design services like web page and product development, graphic design, packaging and prototyping. The IDC project was created at the University of Turabo with public and private funds. FabLab Puerto Rico is the tool that takes care of the fabrication and R\u0026D services provided for small and medium business. We work with inventors, designers and commercial institutions. This commercial side of the operation of the Lab hires students and professors to promote hands on experiences with the reality of our industry.\r\n\r\n4.\tEducation -- Open to any student from any educational institutions in Puerto Rico. Fee based $30.00/ hour (on digital equipment only). Must be an academic project. FabLab PR organizes a series of free seminars for the general public on digital fabrication and traditional fabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nFabLab Puerto Rico was conceived to be a formal FabLab, and has available the equipment and the commitment to collaborate with community-based initiatives as well as design and creative industries. \r\nThe Lab is offering free access for collaborations in an effort to have open access to the general public. \r\n\r\nThe Caribbean is a new frontier and we want to share the FabLab network and its power to share and transform to the rest of our neighbors. We are makers, love to help, collaborate, experiment, teach and learn. \r\n\r\nWelcome to FabLab Puerto Rico\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\nFabLab Director\r\nIdalia N.

The lab was guided by professors and teacher assistants that provide the students with both theoretical and practical support to help them to develop the ideas. In these years, diverse projects were realized within the lab: from an electronic nose to detect ethane in biodigesters to an orthopedic hand with the control servomechanisms to provide movement to disabled boy. In the lab, Postgraduate students may find specific support to test new methods, algorithms or whatever can be provided by it. In the last years, students from foreign countries have participated in activities within the lab. During this time, the lab was opened beyond schools and universities and now different people with techonlogical interests participate actively in it. \r\nAt first, the lab counted with just a few elements, most of them used in regular computer engineering and electronic courses. Each semester, based on the needs of the different projects, new equipment was incorporated. At the moment there are two 3D printers, several osciloscopes, multimeters, Arduino and ARM kits, Raspberry and BeagleBond platforms, electronic components, and so on. There are also several peripherals to support communication, store, and display of data. There are also a drone and a mini drone and autonomous radio controlled cars. In the future, a mini CNC will be incorporated to the lab with several other tools like the laser cutter. \r\nLaboratorio Abierto DIEC is an creative space where people learn and develop computing projects in an interdisciplinary and collaborative way. Although it is possible  to develop an idea individually, most of them are developed in teams of at least two persons. Different disciplines like chemestry, mechanics, agronomics, or even social areas like economy or pedagogy used the lab as a place to propose and test new ideas. This produces a very rich interchange and interdisciplinary approach to the problems.\r\nThe lab collaborates also with different initiatives like science faiss and early vocation test programs in high schools. In this way, the activity of the lab is present in other cities and regions of the country.\r\n","slug":"laboratorioabiertodiec","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/11/28/22/03/53/9cdda209-d752-4a56-b93d-3754ea9c56d8/circular.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/11/28/22/03/53/784fb29f-1e54-46d6-82e8-e49d7594dcb5/LAB.jpg","address_1":"San Andrés 800","address_2":"","city":"Bahía Blanca","county":"","postal_code":"B8001","country_code":"AR","latitude":-38.6953994,"longitude":-62.254295,"address_notes":"DIEC building, ground floor, right hand, last-second door.","phone":"+542914595101 int 3372","email":"laboratorioabiertodiec@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":5208,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/LaboAbiertoDIEC/ "},{"id":5209,"url":"http://laboabierto.diec.uns.edu.ar/"},{"id":5210,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/tallerArduinoAndroid/ "},{"id":5211,"url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAhpD_wp9Fb67DQLR3gy0tcNxaJ4saLM/view?usp=sharing"},{"id":5212,"url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IM1CsxukIX_nuteBkk-Dmkqddm6DXJ5h/view?usp=sharing"}]},{"id":1532,"name":"Hexlab Makerspace","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":1042,"blurb":"HexLab Makerspace is a community workshop giving people access to learn new crafts, use tools, and teach classes.","description":"HexLab Makerspace is a community workshop giving people access to learn new crafts, use our specialized tools and teach classes.

We enable makers of all kinds to imagine, design and create using open source software and DIY equipment. We do this by working with a local and international network to actively cultivate public engagement through community-focused art, entrepreneurship, research and education.\r\n\r\nPhysically, our Fab Lab is an advanced workshop space for rapid prototyping and computer-based design.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a suite of fabrication machines, including a laser engraver, CNC routers, 3D printers and scanners, electronic cutters, digital textile machines, small board electronics, graphic drawing tablets, advanced software and more. We collaborate with several grant projects and community partners locally to provide similar tools at a variety of other locations, including public libraries and after-school centers.\r\n\r\nCulturally, the CUC Fab Lab is driven by a community of practice, people often referred to as Makers.\r\n\r\nOpen-Source Movement Makers like us are are united by the desire to share knowledge, collaborate and to “make almost anything.” Our lab is open to the public, employs both staff and volunteers and greatly values both diversity and play, as we believe these are necessary for innovation. Our network and patrons include people of all kinds: students, teens, families, entrepreneurs, artists, hobbyists, gamers, hackers, engineers, scientists, teachers, librarians, activists and more. We welcome those interested to join the conversation and discover more about who we are!\r\n\r\nFunctionally, Fab Labs encourage people to become makers by exploring the entire design process.\r\n\r\nThey do this by providing tools, human assistance and inspiration that enable people to go from (1) concepts and questions to (2) digital designs and models to (3) physical prototypes and redesigns to (4) a final product they can share, which may in turn help others begin the cycle. This process is rather unique because it is possible for people with little technological expertise to engage in design thinking to develop complex creations using technology and knowledge previously only available to expert artists and engineers. Our lab specializes in working with individuals, groups and organizations to provide makerspace curriculum and related programming.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally, our Fab Lab is a public engagement program of the Illinois Informatics Institute.\r\n\r\nWe work with a variety of units, including The Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Department of Business Administration, School of Art and Design and Institute for Computing in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences to collaborate on grants, facilitate classes and support research. Although many places might be referred to as a fab lab, our Fab Lab is part of the global network connected to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Bits and Atoms. This collaborative network connects institutions around the world with common tools, software platforms and ideologies to facilitate the open exchange of ideas and designs.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, we believe the open source ethos of the Fab Lab inspires interest and innovation in many fields.\r\n\r\nWe strive to connect computer-based making and rapid fabrication to many areas, like art and design, computer science, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, and technical trades. We think community access, provided at a reasonable cost and in cooperation with the global Fab Lab network, builds local capacities by enabling personal growth, economic development and cross-cultural understanding. Activities at the Fab Lab and our partner sites embody the principle of life-long learning by cultivating digital literacies, including cognitive skills like computational, divergent or critical thinking, but also related cultural competencies and other underlying traits that prove fundamental to holistic learning, such as civic engagement or confidence with art and technology.","slug":"cucommunityfablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/11/28/d2d9e96a-6345-4d8e-a41f-ad9a25b2cb5a/Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/12/24/20/40/26/da46086c-0b00-4ea7-a331-7e0b7ed370a0/FabCollageCollege.jpg","address_1":"1301 S Goodwin Ave","address_2":"Art Annex 2","city":"Urbana","county":"Illinois","postal_code":"61801","country_code":"US","latitude":40.1018902,"longitude":-88.2247705,"address_notes":"It's across the street from the ACES library (the octagon-shaped building)","phone":"(217) 265-5342","email":"communityfablab@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":122,"url":"http://cucfablab.org"},{"id":1531,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/CUCfablab"},{"id":1532,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpmcZseAYp1Vx105axSLfXw/videos"}]},{"id":1662,"name":"Fablab des 3 Lapins","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Le Fablab des 3 Lapins est orienté développement économique du territoire; nous utilisons toutes les technologies numériques pour créer de l'emploi, de l'activité , du lien social et du mieux vivre","description":"Notre but est d'engager notre territoire dans un changement de comportement et d'usage; nous essayons de connecter les citoyens et les entreprises avec la monde du libre, pour permettre une innovation vertueuse et un développement respectueux de l'humain et de l'environnement.

Set up as a huge laboratory/workshop, it is equipped with innovative machines and served by a team of experts in the fields of design, 3D printing, coding, electronics, robotics and automation.\r\n\r\nIts areas of specialisation particularly focus on enabling technologies linked to robotic and additive manufacturing, to extracting meaning from Big Data and to the Internet of Everything, and their application to four industrial sectors: Fashion \u0026 Design, Biomedical, Architecture \u0026 Advanced Manufacturing and Cultural Heritage \u0026 Museum Installations.\r\n\r\nD.RE.A.M. occupies an extensive area of over 1,000 sq.m. located on the grounds of Città della Scienza. In the pursuit of its activities, it avails itself of:\r\n\r\n• a digital fabrication laboratory equipped with vanguard technology\r\n\r\n• spacious training facilities;\r\n\r\n• a dedicated coworking zone;\r\n\r\n• areas for experimentation on innovative projects;\r\n\r\n• training rooms and FabLabs for schools;\r\n\r\n• start-up incubation spaces for manufacture 4.0-related enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe technological D.RE.A.M. centre is located in the Marie Curie pavilion which stretches over an area of more than 500 sq.m. situated in the heart of the Città della Scienza (City of Science): a fascinating place of great standing, it guards a prestigious industrial past which perfectly fits the new technological and productive calling of the modern Laboratory.\r\n\r\nIt also features our FabLab dei Piccoli (FabLab for little'uns), a special learning zone for families, schools and young makers who are provided with the chance to get up close to digital technology, teaching activities and dedicated junior laboratories.\r\n\r\nAs well as D.RE.A.M., Città della Scienza has recently worked to have Campania NewSteel set up. This is a huge certified incubator whose purpose is to rekindle the creation of innovative startups, attracting venture capital investment in the ICT field and in the manufacture 4.0 sector.\r\n\r\nAnother step along the way which furthers the strategy to launch digital fabrication is the International Centre for Technological Transfer, a structure sponsored by NETVAL, by the University of Studies of Naples Federico II, by the University of Bergamo and by Città della Scienza. The mutual aim is to lend support to the Italian research system as it moves inexorably towards internationalisation.\r\n\r\nBrought into being by the project entitled \"CDS 2.0 - new products and services for a knowledge-based economy\" and funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research, D.RE.A.M. is a dedicated tool placed at the service of the national strategy for the re-industrialisation of Italy in line with the Italian Research Programme 2015-2020 and the National \"Industry 4.0\" Plan.\r\n\r\nIts aim is to nurture the education and training of specialised human capital; to contribute to the dissemination of new digital technologies in the industrial sector, using open-innovation strategies and other means; to promote experimentation, development and the proliferation of innovative projects and startups in the field of Manufacturing 4.0.\r\n\r\nThis is the aspiration behind our D.RE.A.M Academy, - an international school intended to train talented youngsters for Industry 4.0 as well as for the host of capable individuals working in the universe of FabLabs, innovative companies, research centres, schools and universities.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Academy is to channel the innovative potential and the \"scattered\" pockets of achievement around us, providing them with a structured frame; this is of supreme importance, if we are to make the most of the opportunities that the new industrial revolution has to offer.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the course of study is to enhance creativity and technical competence in youngsters and to hone the design prowess of technicians and craftsmen who have, over the centuries, acted as fine ambassadors of Italy's greatness in the world.","slug":"dreamfablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/34/54/d3f9b204-8b60-4e8c-9508-d404f1bbe000/D.RE.A.M.

Focusing on a single technology allows us to be highly proficient in one topic, instead of average at multiple ones.\r\n\r\n2)\tPublic Fabrication and prototyping space\r\nOpened for everyone whether they are university students or not, offering workshops in different aspects of digital fabrication and access to tools and equipment.\r\n\r\n3)\tMiddleman between academia and industry\r\nThis is to close the gap between academia and the industry in the country by creating opportunities for students to solve real world problems in the Salvadoran industry through innovative ideas and commercialization of technology. On the other hand this also positions 3DLAB as a professional talent generator by developing the relevant skillsets in UTEC students with these industrial experiences\r\n\r\nOur current goal is to become a Fablab to position us in the global map of Fab Foundation as the first Fab Lab in a university in El Salvador. Next steps include fostering collaborative projects between regional and international fablabs, as well as graduating some members from the Fab Academy to then be able to host the Fab Academy and teach these courses to members from the community to grow the Salvadoran maker community. In preparation for this we are currently expanding our facility to offer more workspace, which will be available by the end of July 2019. \r\n\r\nFinally, we aim to be the leading academic fablab in Central America, and a renowned lab in Latin America, in terms of education quality, social impact, and technological research and development.\r\n","slug":"3dlabutec","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/07/03/17/30/33/6d46105f-db1c-4df0-a81f-e11110043068/3dlab_logo.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/10/23/21/03/12/5ec3357e-f4bc-41f9-a272-895c844ff729/Fab Lab 3dlab.jpg","address_1":"Edificio Dr. José Adolfo Araujo","address_2":"Calle Arce y, 19 Avenida sur No. 1045","city":"San Salvador","county":"San Salvador","postal_code":"","country_code":"SV","latitude":13.6995163,"longitude":-89.2010556,"address_notes":"The main entrance is through the building “Dr. José Adolfo Araujo”, down the hall, going through the garden, then to the right.\r\n---\r\nLa entrada principal es por el edificio “Dr. José Adolfo Araujo”, a través del pasillo, pasando por el jardín, y después a la derecha","phone":"+503 2275 1023","email":"3dlab@utec.edu.sv","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":7298,"url":"http://www.instagram.com/3dlabutec"},{"id":7297,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/3dlabutec"}]},{"id":1674,"name":"La Fab'Brique - Béarn des Gaves","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"La Fab'Brique is a meeting point and technical resource for makers and learners in a rural environment which is in the process of transition and economic development.","description":"The lab facility is located in the southwest of France in Sauveterre-de-Béarn at La Station, a new business incubator.

SDU has been a pioneer in using innovative, low-cost technologies to transfer scientific knowledge and education to and from the developing world.  Early 2013 they launched ICTP’s 3D Printing Lab with low-cost technologies. This activity was further supported by the First International Workshop on Low-cost 3D Printing for Science, Education and Sustainable Development, together with the publishing of a popular open book on the topic that has been then translated into multiple languages.\r\n\r\nWe foresee that ICTP’s Scientific FabLab will be exported to the developing world, specially across the ICTP’s research networks, and extended to empower scholars, scientists, and individuals there.

The field of interaction between man and machine is also of special research interest within FabLabs.","slug":"ictpscifablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/10/09/20/29/d900abe9-b6b9-49e5-ac72-94ab7319b09f/8993301D-2657-4CBE-9E53-830804EC25C1.jpeg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/01/10/09/21/52/8a168b6a-e30c-41bb-85e1-6c1d80e47b54/736A3499-698D-40E1-B090-39D41A6688F4.jpeg","address_1":"Via Beirut 6, Grignano","address_2":"ICTP Fermi Building","city":"TRIESTE","county":"Friuli Venezia Giulia","postal_code":"34151","country_code":"IT","latitude":45.7043138,"longitude":13.7198258,"address_notes":"ICTP Miramare Campus","phone":"+39  040 2240 317","email":"scifablab@ictp.it","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":811,"url":"http://scifablab.org"}]},{"id":47,"name":"Fablab Nairobi","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"","description":"","slug":"fablabnairobi","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/10/45/7838d689-c661-4a4a-8183-8b97b605f0e5/Fablab Nairobi.jpg","header_url":null,"address_1":"30197","address_2":"","city":"Nairobi","county":"Nairobi","postal_code":"00100 (GPO)","country_code":"KE","latitude":-1.2790019,"longitude":36.8170395,"address_notes":"","phone":"","email":"stp@uonbi.ac.ke","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":1930,"url":"http://twitter.com/fablabnairobi"},{"id":1931,"url":"http://youtube.com/fablabnairobi"},{"id":1932,"url":"https://twitter.com/fablaboutreach"},{"id":1933,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/FabLab-Nairobi-Outreach-220691117976348/"},{"id":1934,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/fablabnairobi/"},{"id":2236,"url":"https://fablaboutreach.wordpress.com/"},{"id":2237,"url":"http://fablab.uonbi.ac.ke"}]},{"id":290,"name":"icecairo","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"icecairo is a not-for-profit Green Tech innovation hub, focusing on solving environmental/social community challenges.","description":"icecairo is a not-for-profit Green Tech innovation hub, based in Cairo Egypt. \r\n\r\n3D printers: 2 x Stratasys Dimension SST 1200ES, 1 x MakerBot Replicator 2\r\nLaser Cutters: 1 x Universal Laser System VLS4.60 Laser Cutter \u0026 Engraver, 2 x LaserPro C180 Laser Cutter \u0026 Engraver\r\nCNC machines: 2 x BZT PFK-1203-PK CNC Portal Milling Machine\r\nPower tools, hand tools, soldering equipment, arduino, Raspberry Pis etc\r\n","slug":"icecairo","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/14/23/4de61b46-8214-44b9-af38-6e3bdf01d2dd/icecairo.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/13/50/54/26563689-3adc-4538-ac4d-439519230f46/icecairo.jpg","address_1":"32 Sabri Abo Alam Street","address_2":"1st floor, apartment 8, Downtown","city":"Cairo","county":"","postal_code":"11111","country_code":"EG","latitude":30.0466563,"longitude":31.2403699,"address_notes":"Just off Talaat Harb Square, behind the legendary Tahrir Square.

Francesco Bombardi (*) who, after getting into contact with Fab Lab Amsterdam and many professionals working in other laboratories (Enrico Bassi Fab Lab Torino, Massimo Menichinelli Aalto Factory), decided to replicate the same experience in Reggio Emilia. After several consultations, the project was first presented to a number of possible promoters such as Reggio Emilia Innovation (REI), the Province of Reggio Emilia and the City Council, before being approved by the Board of Directors in July 2012. The settlement on the premises of Spazio Gerra (made available by Reggio Emilia City Council) took place in September 2012, while the official opening was held on October 27 of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia's mission is twofold: on one hand to support the companies in the paths of innovation and development of new ideas and projects through the development of people and interdisciplinary skills.\r\nThe Fab Lab launched  the  IDEA CHALLENGE formula, preparing a detailed brief with the company and guiding work groups (interdisciplinary)  to realize prototypes in one-two days time, using digital fabrication tools and know-how.\r\nProducts realized : 12 V Coffe Machine ( with Redox) , New Products in Polistirolo Espanso ( with CoopBox ), Digital Garden Kit ( in progress with IREN Rinnovabili), stencil customization for painting  decoration indoor ( with Litokol), Gadgets for Fotografia Europea 2013, condom twitter display ( with Industree for Durex).\r\n\r\nThe Fab Lab Reggio Emilia is connected with Università di Modena e Reggio, Dipartimento di Scienze e Metodi di Ingegneria where Francesco Bombardi is helding a course of Industrial Design rapid prototyping.\r\nOne of the project-ptrototype developed by the student has been presented to Ferrari in Maranello.\r\nAnother was presented during the BarCamper tour ( accelerometro for guitar)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Fab Lab is choosing some topics to research as to be able to  internally produce prototypes and propose them to users , institutions or companies.\r\nProducts : 3D Printer adaptation (with Redox) , window dynamic display unit (with UnderDesign) , fab –valigia for schools (with Chiara Ferraboschi and Officina Educativa), Paesaggi di Formaggio (with Parmigiano Reggiano)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to allow individuals and / or communities to access tools useful to learn, experiment, prototype and self-produce, contributing to the emergence of new entrepreneurial projects.\r\nWorkshops: 3d printing, 3d scanning, laser cutting, robotics, tangible diagrams, 3d modeling, interaction design, fashion design, jewelry, cnc milling.\r\nWorkshop for schools and dedicated workshops for architects and managers ( INARC, CNA Emilia Romagna, MUSE Trento)\r\n\r\nReggio Emilia Innovazione (REI) has studied the economic feasibility and has also directly funded the fab lab's activities. The City Council has provided the location in the heart of the city center, materializing the idea of an Urban Factory, in close contact with the citizens and city's cultural events thanks to Spazio Gerra managers.\r\n\r\nThe fab lab is powered by Reggio Emilia Innovazione and managed and directed by Francesco Bombardi,  with the collaboration of Fernando Arias Sandoval.\r\nSeveral public and private actors have shared the fab lab's mission and took part in the project directly contributing for its realization.

The facility provides physical spaces, tools and equipment to support makers in bringing their dream projects to fruition. Additionally, it also serves as a nexus for the gathering of inventive minds where they can learn, share and collaborate to think up the next big thing. We believe that the maker movement in Singapore will be a way to tap and grow our own capability and talent, doing something that we love and are passionate about.\r\n\r\n Since our formation, we have been operating our anchor makerspace, the Makerspace@NDC (previously known as Prototyping Lab@NDC) at the National Design Centre. We are also contracted to design, equip and manage other makerspaces for external organisations, schools and tertiary institutions. All our locations are equipped with the latest digital fabrication tools, electronics kits and machine tools along with conducive workspaces.

En parte la relevancia de un laboratorio de fabricación digital radica en poder hacer algo que no sea posible conseguir en el mercado. La personalización y la “customización” entonces aparecen como valores agregados que llevados a una mayor escala conducen a una producción en masa no serializada en lugar de la producción en masa y en serie obtenida con los medios industriales de producción tradicionales.\r\n\r\nEl laboratorio puede estar orientado a diversos campos de producción material. En el campo de la arquitectura resulta una herramienta sumamente potente pues no solo expande las posibilidades técnicas y tectónicas de la profesión sino que también permite imaginar otras posibilidades y otras arquitecturas atentas a las problemáticas de producción, economía en inclusive medio ambientales que enfrentamos actualmente.\r\n\r\nEn términos disciplinares los campos de conocimiento a los que puede aportar el LAB son todos aquellos en los que la producción material es inherente. La arquitectura y construcción, el diseño industrial y gráfico, las ingenierías, las artes, las ciencias aplicadas e inclusive la programación de software pueden hacer uso de un LAB como centro de producción e innovación. Lo particularmente importante de esto es que, además de que cada una de estas disciplinas encuentra un espacio para la experimentación, el LAB promueve la interdisciplinariedad a partir de abrir las posibilidades a proyectos mixtos utilizando el conocimiento propio de cada una de estas áreas.","slug":"fablabcolmayor","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/10/09/23/36/12/2a820bfb-6460-43ae-8f22-3f4fbfa4d7fc/LOGO.jpeg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/10/09/23/36/12/9493e852-742c-4ab1-9baf-65ee49adaff6/HEADER.jpeg","address_1":"Carrera 78 # 65 - 46 Bloque Patrimonial - Piso 1 - A169","address_2":"","city":"Medellín","county":"Antioquia","postal_code":"","country_code":"CO","latitude":6.2728146,"longitude":-75.589807,"address_notes":"Bloque Patrimonial - Piso 1 - A169","phone":"+573003609367","email":"lab.fabricaciondigital@colmayor.edu.co","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":18129,"url":"http://www.fabcolmayor.com"}]},{"id":586,"name":"Fab LAB Trojmiasto","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"eduction, 3d printing, Laser cutting, CNC milling","description":"Fab Lab Trójmiasto has begun its operation in 2012.

As young engineers and scientist amongst us we, formulated ZEOLF to be the core foundation of technology in Rwanda but mainly focusing on challenges the country and different communities around the globe face and come up with a solution. \r\n\r\nDuring the moment of 2015 climate change was the main topic that awakened governments and states to take this challenge so serious. Even thought there are still debate to what is causing the climate change including natural phenomena, nevertheless carbon emission that is clouding the earth atmosphere and trap the heat in spherical earth like cloud also accelerates the pace of global warming which also sets the unpredictable changes such as high heat or extreme negative temperature to most winter experiencing areas. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the impossible ZEOLF started to examine the possible workable solutions that as Rwanda would need depending on resources available and that could be more efficient. Today there’s a hype of solar cell to become the ultimate solution even as researchers, we already know the best solar cell of between 28-32% efficiency is extremely expensive compare to China’s manufactured solar cells which could be at 15-18% efficiency or in between of the best. Our solution to combine the use of both solar cells and Hydrogen fuel cell for rural electrification. \r\n\r\nOur design which will be unveiled next year 2020 shall feature the key technological achievements that provides in between 50-60% fuel cell efficiency and drop of 40% efficient to overall use.

The goals of the early childhood Fab Lab include providing quality STEM experiences that empower children as thinkers and problem solvers, invite children to imagine, test, and refine solutions to improve the world, foster curiosity, persistence, and deep understanding, promote shared learning between children and adults, and produce deep content outcomes. Children, their families, and teachers will access the Fab Lab primarily through workshops (ranging from 45 minutes to 2 hours). During the week, these workshops will be offered to preschools and elementary schools as facilitated field trips. On the weekends, they will be offered to families as part of our public programs.

It's located in Guarda at ESTG/IPG","description":"Set up in 2008, the rapid prototyping laboratory of the Polytechnic Institute of Guarda has helped the local and regional community in the field of innovation from the very beginning. Initially, it only provided support to some innovators in digital 3D modelling and 3D printing with their models and prototypes. At that time some spin-offs were using this lab to carry out their experiments, leading to, in some cases, the registration of patents in the areas of engineering and industrial design.\r\nThese days the support provided to the community is much broader in the field of prototyping and digital manufacturing, thanks to modern tools that are now available in FabLab Guarda. These tools allow the manufacture of a product from the starting point of a virtual model using various types of technological processes apart from 3D printing. With an appropriate computer and software, models can be made using a very potent CNC Router, a precision milling machine, laser cutting machines and vinyl cutting and 3D printers. In addition, the lab has a set of machines and tools such as lathes, precision milling machines, grinding machines, a calender and various soldering processes.\r\nOur best skills are the digital 3D modelling and the development of mechanical devices. The IPrinterG is a living example of these skills. It is a 3D printer machine completely developed and built in the FabLab environment and it was developed as a Fabacademy 2013 final coursework project. The IPrinterG has a reasonable precision and it is a very robust machine and it really helps our students and “makers” to produce their models at a very low cost.\r\nFabLab Guarda shares its facilities with the School of Higher Education in Technology and Management which administers courses in Equipment Design and Computer Science; has various woodcutting and transformation machines, so that it can easily deal with projects of this nature. Computer Science students also use the resources of FabLab to carry out their projects, mainly with applications in the area of robotics. \r\nWe are beginning a process of connecting to all schools and levels of education in the surrounding area to offer them FabLab resources and to introduce the concept of “learn by doing” by reaching out to both young children and high school students. FabLab Guarda is located in the city of Guarda, in the interior of Portugal, very close to the Spanish border. The main objective of its sponsor, the Research Unit for Inland Development, is to contribute to the technological development of this region. Furthermore, we believe that the connection to the FabLab community in Portugal and at the international level can be a great help in developing projects and exploring new ideas, which can lead to business opportunities.\r\n\r\n","slug":"fablabguarda","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/30/35/0cd99348-f973-4a71-bfa8-83ca36179c93/Fab Lab Guarda.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/50/54/ee6182c7-57aa-4510-94f3-cf02593b4734/Fab Lab Guarda.jpg","address_1":"I P G  -  Instituto Politécnico da Guarda      ","address_2":"Av.

Luoghi che diano nuovo significato alla “ricerca di lavoro,” rendendolo non più “individuazione di chi possa darmi qualcosa da fare” bensì “autogenerazione di un lavoro per me”, facendo leva sullo spirito di innovazione e di imprenditorialità di chi voglia beneficiare delle grandi opportunità che oggi offrono le  moderne tecnologie e la web-economy, sempre in  chiave globale e non limitatamente nazionale e microlocale.\r\n\r\n Il Veneto (e Padova in particolare) è tradizionalmente custode di enormi giacimenti di cultura e pensiero ed anche storico portatore di una cultura imprenditoriale basata sulla concretezza e sulla operosità, vocazionalmente strutturata non tanto nella dimensione della grande impresa quanto in quella del pro-attivo laboratorio artigianale a rete/distretto: un contesto particolarmente coerente e compatibile con le linee di sviluppo della  “terza rivoluzione industriale” e cioè, quella dei “makers” e del 3d printing.\r\n\r\n3D PRINT\r\n\r\nLa stampa 3d è il cavallo di battaglia di ogni FabLab. Una tecnologia\r\nincredibilmente versatile che ha rivoluzionato l’industria grazie alle\r\ninfinite possibilità dell’additive manufacturing. Il FabLab è inoltre\r\nrivenditore autorizzato Sharebot.\r\nSono disponibili 4 stampanti 3D a tecnologia FDM e una a tecnologia DLP\r\n\r\nLaser CO2\r\n\r\n Il laser permette di tagliare e incidere pressoché ogni materiale non\r\nmetallico. Una sorgente di luce infrarossa viene concentrata tramite\r\nspecchi e lenti fino a raggiungere forma puntiforme. L’enorme calore,\r\nsu una minuscola superficie permette di ottenere risultati puliti e\r\nprecisi ed angoli netti. Dimensioni di taglio massime: 60X40 cm\r\n\r\nCNC\r\n\r\n La cnc è uno strumento estremamente versatile. Partendo dal pieno\r\nmateriale o viene asportato da una fresa rotante. In questo modo è\r\npossibile tagliare, spianare, forare, incidere e addirittura modellare\r\nin 3d. Tutto in modo altamente automatizzato, partendo da disegni\r\nrealizzati al computer. Dimensioni di lavoro massime: 80X60 cm\r\n\r\nElettroniLab\r\n\r\nUna postazione elettronica attrezzata, computer, due postazioni di\r\nsaldatura e tutto il necessario per produrre circuiti stampati.\r\nNell’ElettroniLab del FabLab puoi riparare, progettare, assemblare\r\ndispositivi elettronici.\r\n\r\nFai-Da-Te\r\n\r\nQuale è lo scopo di un FabLab?

CNC e personale qualificato ne fanno un polo di eccellenza e di innovazione tecnologica","description":"Make in Nuoro è nato nel 2016 per volontà della CCIAA Nuoro che ha individuato nel modello dei fablab la strada per rivitalizzare e sostenere la tradizione manifatturiera ed artigiana del territorio sardo agendo direttamente dall’interno del sistema; Infatti, gli artigiani da secoli tramandano conoscenze e saperi di carattere pratico che potrebbero trovare nuova linfa nella relazione diretta con i FabLab. La terza rivoluzione industriale offre molte opportunità; Attraverso Make in Nuoro vogliamo incoraggiare una maggiore cultura dell’innovazione sul territorio per far sì che queste opportunità vengano colte. Tecnologia e sviluppo vanno di pari passo e il loro effetto positivo è ancora più incisivo laddove si mettono in atto metodologie di collaborazione. Le risorse che Make in Nuoro vuole condividere con il territorio puntano a rafforzare questi meccanismi e a consolidare il rapporto tra innovazione e realtà locali.\r\n\r\nA chi ci rivolgiamo:\r\nLe imprese: Che si tratti di rinnovamento di prodotto o di processo, le imprese interessate ad esplorare le possibilità offerte dalle nuove tecnologie digitali presenti nel nostro fablab Make in Nuoro, avranno a disposizione strumenti e tecnologie innovative.\r\nGli artigiani: L’artigianato rappresenta da sempre una delle eccellenze italiane. Cogliere le opportunità offerte dai nuovi processi di digitalizzazione favorisce l’internazionalizzazione dei prodotti e apre anche innumerevoli occasioni d’interscambio. Grazie al fablab Make in Nuoro, gli artigiani avranno la possibilità di far crescere la propria attività o creare start up artigiane con vocazione “digitale”.\r\nGli studenti: Stimolare la crescita e il potenziale creativo dei giovani è un’opportunità di sviluppo e di occupazione. Make in Nuoro si propone come ponte tra la scuola e le realtà produttive del territorio; ma anche come stimolo per la nascita di nuove imprese che potranno vedere la luce grazie all’inventiva degli stessi ragazzi.\r\nCorsi, laboratori, workshop cercheranno di attivare le energie creative latenti attraverso un modello di apprendimento basato sul fare, pensato proprio per le professioni del futuro.\r\nI professionisti: Spazi di condivisione di saperi e progetti per fare ricerca e sperimentazione. I professionisti potranno innovare l’attività che già svolgono oppure creare nuovi servizi ad alto valore tecnologico. I macchinari e il know how offerti da Make in Nuoro mirano a soddisfare le richieste di makers creativi, con idee da prototipare, condividere, implementare.\r\n\r\nCosa offriamo:\r\nIl nostro fablab dispone di spazi di laboratorio dotati di strumenti elettronici e macchine CNC per la produzione e prototipazione digitale.\r\nIl nostro laboratorio è fornito sia dell’attrezzatura classica per lavori artigianali, sia di macchine utensili per lavorazioni più complesse ed impegnative. Oltre all’attrezzatura di base vi sono macchine a controllo numerico (CNC) vero cuore del laboratorio, con le quali eseguire lavorazioni in un percorso interamente digitale dall’ideazione alla realizzazione. \r\nSi potranno realizzare manufatti con materiali diversi e con diverse tecnologie, dall’incisione alla fresatura, dalla stampa 3d al taglio plotter ecc.. \r\n\r\nLa formazione è una delle attività più importanti nel nostro fablab. A questa, infatti, abbiamo dedicato l’intero primo piano della struttura, dotandolo di aule attrezzate con tutti gli strumenti necessari (videoproiettore, connessione wifi, pc, ecc…) per la realizzazione di corsi, workshop e attività laboratoriali volte a trasmettere conoscenze sulla progettazione assistita, sulle tecniche di fabbricazione digitale e sulla prototipazione elettronica. \r\n\r\nInfine il fablab Make in Nuoro offre spazi di co-working allestiti con tutte le attrezzature e le strumentazioni necessarie (tavoli, wifi libero, stampanti ecc..) per permettere agli utenti di pianificare e sviluppare la propria giornata lavorativa. \r\nLa tecnologia digitale offre oggi nuove possibilità che affrancano i territori dall’isolamento e consentono a tutti l’accesso all’informazione e alla tecnologia.\r\nIn questo scenario in continua evoluzione, Make in Nuoro vuole essere un luogo di innovazione e rinnovamento dei processi e prodotti delle pmi sarde cavalcando il cambiamento per rispondere alle esigenze delle aziende del territorio, offrendo loro le opportunità derivanti dai processi di digitalizzazione, per essere sempre più competitive in un mercato globale.\r\n\r\n","slug":"makeinnuoro","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/30/27/7644c37d-502e-4661-8b96-111ec3a87dbf/Make in Nuoro.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/50/44/2c9acdc7-7fb1-4c5a-a4f3-dc995902bf5b/Make in Nuoro.jpg","address_1":"Via Pasquale Paoli, 2","address_2":"","city":"Nuoro","county":"Italia","postal_code":"08100","country_code":"IT","latitude":40.326371,"longitude":9.30709090000005,"address_notes":"Make in Nuoro si trova presso l’AILUN in via Pasquale Paoli, 2 all’ingresso di Nuoro per chi proviene dalla ss 131.\r\nL’accesso al parcheggio è da viale Funtana Buddia.\r\n\r\nCome raggiungerci:\r\n\r\nPer chi proviene da fuori Nuoro\r\nDalla SS. 131 all’ingresso di Nuoro seguire le indicazioni per Ospedale/Quartiere Funtana Buddia.\r\nPrendere lo svincolo in discesa a destra, all’incrocio svoltare a destra in viale Funtana Buddia e proseguire per 100 mt.\r\nPer l’accesso al parcheggio Ailun svoltare a sinistra sulla strada sterrata.\r\n\r\nPer chi proviene dal centro di Nuoro\r\nSeguire le indicazioni per uscire dalla città in direzione OSPEDALE.\r\nDopo la grande rotonda con la fontana, proseguire dritti per via Mannironi e procedere per 3 km affiancando sulla destra il Parco della Pineta di Ugolio.\r\nSvoltare a sinistra in viale Funtana Buddia, attraversare il sottopassaggio e procedere sempre su viale Funtana Buddia per circa 100 mt.\r\n\r\nL’AILUN si trova nel grande caseggiato bianco sulla sinistra.","phone":"(+39) 0784226200","email":"info@makeinnuoro.it","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":null,"links":[]},{"id":1125,"name":"Blolab Cotonou","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":21,"blurb":"Design and fabrication for spreading sciences and technologies through open source and open hardware projects.","description":"Design and fabrication for spreading sciences and technologies through open source and open hardware projects.","slug":"blolabcotonou","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/30/29/444b8fc2-0975-40f4-9831-63c05eb890cf/Blolab Cotonou.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/50/46/625c40a6-a14a-4efb-9820-4438d52256bc/Blolab Cotonou.jpg","address_1":"Cotonou","address_2":"","city":"Cotonou","county":"Cotonou","postal_code":"229","country_code":"BJ","latitude":6.3704004,"longitude":2.3921603,"address_notes":"Quartier Kindonou, 2e immeuble après la pharmacie en quittant le CEG Le Nokoué, 3e étage.","phone":"(229) 97 38 31 74","email":"contact@blolab.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing"],"activity_status":null,"links":[{"id":1994,"url":"http://www.blolab.org"}]},{"id":1127,"name":"Fablab XI’AN","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":736,"blurb":"Fablab Xi’an is located in southwest conner of Bianjiacun Cross Xi’an, the mid-core zone of 3 famous universities—Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xidian University\u0026Northwest University.","description":"The lab is an essential component of CASStar \u0026Vanke Cloud Maker Space,  which is a professional incubate platform for deep technology, applies itself to the 1st one-stop maker community in northwest China.

This will be a resource space that the school and community will be able to use to explore innovation, ingenuity, and creativity through technology. It will be a \"YES\" space where people can explore without fear in a safe setting. The center will also explore integration of curricular areas through collaborative projects and teamwork. With a planned opening date of early October 2016, the Innovation Center hopes to partner with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to become a certified Fab Lab. This partnership will allow the students of the Waunakee Community School District to become part of the global creative network by sharing their designs and knowledge with other Fab Lab's across the world.\r\n\r\nScience, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (also known as STEAM) education represents a large portion of our students and the new frontier of exploration. According to the US Department of Education, STEAM career growth is projected to rise 14% by 2020. The Innovation Center will offer a unique space where STEAM education will be able to be experienced by students and community. Our students will be able to grow their STEAM skills through courses offered in the Waunakee Community School District and then expand those skills through the Innovation Center. The space will also offer a chance for community education classes to be offered to help introduce community members to new technologies becoming more prevalent in traditional areas. After initial set up of the Innovation Center, the possibility exists that the space will be able to be open to members of the community to use for work on projects, explore hobbies and learn new skills. \r\n\r\nWith the focus of the future workforce on 21st century skills (soft-skills), the creative problem solving process will become more and more important. The Innovation Center will allow students AND community a place to test out the research and development process while allowing participants to embark on a journey from idea to physical model. This practical experience will also allow participants to hone critical skills needed in everyday life.","slug":"waunakeehighschoolinnovationcenterfablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/33/30/c18f6922-850c-4f26-9d6e-db8813ba82c1/Waunakee High School Innovation Center Fab Lab.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/54/20/e509bd68-9b7c-4b87-b77e-b81f87a2766b/Waunakee High School Innovation Center Fab Lab.jpg","address_1":"301 Community Dr","address_2":"","city":"Waunakee","county":"","postal_code":"53597","country_code":"US","latitude":43.1830123,"longitude":-89.4574082,"address_notes":"","phone":"16088492169","email":"innovation_center@waunakee.k12.wi.us","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"planned","links":[{"id":2261,"url":"http://www.waunakee.k12.wi.us/high/innovation_center.cfm"},{"id":2262,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=waunakee%20high%20school%20innovation%20center"}]},{"id":1263,"name":"FCT FabLab","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"FCT FabLab is located at the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia of Universidade Nova de Lisboa and so it's an incredible facility for students, researchers and entrepreneurs.","description":"FCT FabLab is located at the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia of Universidade Nova de Lisboa and so it's an incredible facility for students, researchers and entrepreneurs as well as the involving comunity.

Even though they may be late to their next class, they just can’t leave until they finish their final thoughts or adjustments to their designs. The engagement is contagious and has permeated into a culture of innovating and inventing as the students research and develop their ideas to design challenges rather than ripping off and duplicating someone else’s thoughts or ideas. Words cannot really describe the impact that area has had for our students just last year. It acted as a spring board to continue to renovation and add additional equipment in our “Vision Center” / Makerspace arena. Also, a curriculum change that will now provide our students with an Engineering class that will be team taught between a male Technology and Engineering teacher and a female Physics teacher (Of note: the Physics teacher also is an Engineer by trade). The students will then be able to earn a math / science credit for taking this course. This is a giant step for a district our size. By continuing to develop our idea of creating a “Vision Center” and “Maker Space” we have begun to partner with the elementary school to create an “Innovation and Invention” night where the elementary students are invited in to work with high school students to solve similar design challenges. Since our physical plant is equipped with the shared glass that included the ability to monitor the activity in the labs from the hallway, parents and community members can also attend. The parents and community members will be able to actively participate in these design challenges aiding in the creativity process of our students by offering suggestions.

The equipment in the lab is placed there through donations and partnerships through which the owners also agree to give classes to train apprentices and interns as well as maintain the machinery.  Our partners each have over 40 years experience working in their areas including world-renown jewelry design and motor and engine repair and fabrication with the Panama Canal.  Currently classes are given at the lab in arduino, building prototypes using digital to physical technology (3d printers, laser cutters, CNC), equipment training for using lathes and mills and carpentry workshops.  Some of our partners work with disabled communities and host training workshops at the lab for blind and disabled people.  Currently we are also helping the Ministry of Health establish standards for prostheses for upper extremities printed in the country. \r\n","slug":"ecostudio","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/05/16/16/03/00/a07ea456-6b69-4128-b336-98a789ca1802/fab lab panama2.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/02/23/00/26/41/f0ffcbb6-d10f-4668-955c-a2482b33094e/IMG_20170212_150207.jpg","address_1":"Building 245 Dwyer St","address_2":"City of Knowledge","city":"Panama City","county":"Panama","postal_code":"00000","country_code":"PA","latitude":9.0065784,"longitude":-79.5890294,"address_notes":"","phone":"+507-6783-3433","email":"learn@ecostudio.ngo","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"planned","links":[{"id":4422,"url":"http://www.ecostudio.ngo"},{"id":4423,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/ecostudiopanama"}]},{"id":1609,"name":"FABLAB/LPR ENSAM Casablanca","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":887,"blurb":"Fablab LPR/ Laboratoire de prototypage rapide, est un centre de prototypage rapide et de fabrication numérique intégré et hébergé au niveau de l'ENSAM Casablanca.","description":"L'activités principale du Fablab s'articule autour de la fabrication numérique, le prototypage et la Fabrication additive, il dispose d'une multitude de machines et Équipements mis à la disposition des étudiants, chercheurs de l'ENSAM et de l'Université Hassan 2 Casablanca ainsi que tout passionnés du Making ou industriels souhaitant procéder au prototypage et au développement de produits mécatroniques.","slug":"fablablprensamcasablanca","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/12/07/13/45/43/aa5e80c2-a3d3-4f7a-af0d-c9ad840148fc/logo LPR ENSAM CASABLANCA.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/12/07/14/45/03/e88834ca-f6c7-4527-9a6d-c44bb8f874fb/Fablab ENSAM Casablanca.png","address_1":"150 Avenue Nile","address_2":"Sidi Othman","city":"Casablanca","county":"","postal_code":"20670","country_code":"MA","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"address_notes":"150 Avenue Nile Sidi Othman Casablanca 20670 ","phone":"150 Avenue Nile Sidi Othman Casablanca 20670","email":"ennaji.moh@gmail.com","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":5276,"url":"http://www.ensam-casa.ma/"}]},{"id":2110,"name":"HCA Invention Collaboratory","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":761,"blurb":"The HCA Invention Collaboratory was designed to introduce middle school students to Digital Fabrication, Design Thinking and Collaboration by providing access and opportunies to explore making.","description":"The Howard Connect Academy Invention Collaboratory is in a public 6-8 grade school in Chattanooga, TN, an urban setting on the southside of Chattanooga, TN.

FABLAB ULL is a collaborative and interdisciplinary work-space which is centred on the use of digital tools for designing and manufacturing. Artists, engineers, designers, architects, IT specialists and scientists from different disciplines, together with other people interested in interacting with these technologies, converge in this open and multidisciplinary work-space. We place special emphasis on exploring and developing creativity as a common tool for all these disciplines. We work on our own projects as well as on other collaborative projects with organizations and individuals who come to share with us their concerns and needs in the field of computer-aided designing and manufacturing.\r\nOur website (http://fablab.webs.ull.es/) displays some of the most representative projects we have developed, in different areas, in the last 18 months. From Physical Computing projects, based on Arduino technology, to the design of objects using CAD/CAM technologies, the multidisciplinary character of the professionals who have worked with us is crearly reflected. For instance, the work entitled \"Artistic Casting of objects designed by computer, using polylactic acid as a substitute for lost wax casting\" explored the possibility of combining traditional techniques of art with the use of new 3D designing and printing technologies. FABLAB ULL also develops an important formative role that seeks literacy of our community in the use of computer-assisted technology for designing and manufacturing. Our courses, addressed to both adults and school-age young public,  are not necessarily geared to a specialized audience. We work with specific software, giving priority to the use of free and \"open source\" ones. Our main goal is to encourage the creative development of people and enable them to use these technologies as a tool to increase their degree of \"autonomy and self-determination\". Altogether, we contribute to the local development by fostering small economic projects which make use of these technologies.\r\nOver the past year, as a result of the interest created by the activity and production of FABLAB ULL, we have established new collaborations with scientists from different disciplines, such as Biomedicine, Palaeontology or Parasitology. These collaborations led to the creation of a new work-line in the field of Scientific Divulgation, both for specialized professionals and for the general public. We have therefore developed outreach and educational materials addressed to young people and the general public, by using 3D modelling and printing, in order to provide tools to facilitate understanding of different issues of a scientific nature. Among this work, we can highlight the project entitled \"The Cell, unit of life\", carried out in collaboration with teachers and science/biotechnology students from High Schools, following scientific guidance provided by our University and by Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). It consists of a 3D animation which explains, in great detail, the morphology and physiology of the cell, accompanied by a puzzle of a T lymphocyte elaborated by 3D printing. This project prompted us to create a section in our laboratory called \"3D Virtual Lab\". Within this section, we will develop different projects, in order to meet the scientific divulgation and teaching/learning needs of diverse scientific fields.\r\nOur geographical location in the Canary Islands, known for its rich biodiversity and natural heritage, motivates us to carry out projects to raise awareness on global environmental problems and promote initiatives of sustainable development. In this regard, in the near future, we will organize workshops on the concept of \"Biomimicry\" as an inspiration for projects, and to lay the foundations for future creative work and collaborations inspired by nature.\r\n","slug":"fablabull","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/27/51/f6387256-02aa-4b9b-bf91-b71725e9c256/FabLab ULL.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/47/18/87c961c2-cf7b-4da0-8ffe-bf45cd7e7d25/FabLab ULL.jpg","address_1":"Calle Radio Aficionados","address_2":"Apartado 456","city":"San Cristóbal de La Laguna","county":"Santa cruz de Tenerife","postal_code":"38320","country_code":"ES","latitude":28.46465,"longitude":-16.29889,"address_notes":"Fine Arts Faculty building.

Groups like the NWLA Makerspace, and the workshops that they typically provide to the community are a huge asset in building innovation culture, as well as in providing job training for adults, and Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math engagement for children.\r\nA permanent space in Shreveport-Bossier will boost innovation in our area in a number of ways:\r\n- It will provide everyone with access to the tools that have often been access-limited to professionals or large university students.\r\n- It will strengthen local services available to entrepreneurs by increasing opportunities for low-cost product development, rapid prototyping, and even small-scale production.\r\n- It will increase the community’s opportunity to work with and develop an understanding of advanced technologies, a great advantage in both cultural and workforce development.\r\n- It will give more students across Northwest Louisiana access to advanced STEAM skills development.\r\n- It will attach, through Cohab, a business and economic development arm to the makerspace giving makers exposure to business training and development opportunities.\r\nThe space is lead by a strong team of artists, engineers, and technologists who are ready to bring their innovative ideas to our community. In 2018 our goals are to serve 2000 individuals from grade school age through retirement with the introduction of this space and the classes and services it will make possible.\r\nTo move the needle on our community, we have to have creative ideas, and then we have to have a practical way to harness those ideas and craft them into blocks we can build upon.

When we refer to the term digital divide, we refer to the inequality between people who may have access or knowledge to the Internet or to a relationship in the use of new technologies and those who do not. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the 312 Infoplazas nationwide add day by day the greatest effort in Panama in bringing access to the Internet, information, training and knowledge which is necessary for the socio-political, economic and intellectual development of a better Panama. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to promote and participate in the development and use of ICTs as tools to reduce the digital divide that exists in Panama and to democratize access to knowledge, in order to promote social and economic development within a fairer globalized society. \r\n\r\nOur vision is to become an entity recognized as a point of support for national development through the use of ICTs for the benefit of society","slug":"infoplazasDavid","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/05/18/17/06/30/1606a3a4-6b9b-4bc3-a86d-a7d5e03db6d1/logo aip infoplazas.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/05/18/17/06/30/b49f56c2-b1a5-417e-9b86-292f3d4975ea/infoplazas jornada.jpg","address_1":"Avenida segunda","address_2":"","city":"David","county":"Chiriqui","postal_code":"00000","country_code":"PA","latitude":8.42526594565104,"longitude":-82.4294731432861,"address_notes":"8.425000, -82.429694","phone":"+(507) 517-0014","email":"mhotsko@infoplazas.org.pa","capabilities":["three_d_printing"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":7051,"url":"https://www.infoplazas.org.pa/chiriqui/#229"}]},{"id":2162,"name":"Moscow International School","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"This is a Technopark of the state comprehensive school of Moscow.","description":"The main goal of our Technopark is an opportunity for students to study modern technologies and create their own technical projects.","slug":"mis","avatar_url":null,"header_url":null,"address_1":"Zelenyy Prospekt, 14","address_2":"","city":"Moskva","county":"","postal_code":"111141","country_code":"RU","latitude":55.7498606,"longitude":37.7819857,"address_notes":"Здание \"Московской международной школы\", корпус \"Эрида\", Технопарк.","phone":"+7-966-110-4869","email":"add-tech@yandex.ru","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser"],"activity_status":"active","links":[]},{"id":1938,"name":"Fab Lab da Firjan SENAI Itaguaí","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"O laboratório é habilitado para prototipagem com impressão 3D, Corte a Laser, automação, Usinagem em CNC aberta e Mini CNC.","description":"Estamos localizados em um Polo Industrial importante da cidade do Rio de Janeiro, atendemos Indústrias dos setores Metalúrgico, Siderúrgico, Construção Naval e Mineração.\r\nAtuamos sob contrato com essas empresas para fins de treinamentos de empregados, formação de jovem aprendiz, soluções e prototipagem para projetos integradores de fim de curso.\r\nUtilizamos 3 impressoras 3D para, um equipamento de Termo Conformação, Router CNC, Cortadora Laser, Mini CNC fechada, Automação com Arduino e Lego, Plotter de Impressão e Plotter de recorte em Vinil adesivo, sala de reuniões e Computadores instalados com Fusion 360, Autodesk Inventor, Autocad entre outros.","slug":"fablabdafirjansenaiitaguai","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/02/05/17/23/00/0cff6620-2f48-4b2c-9190-253c4fa1fa03/icones-fablab-01-01.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/03/01/22/36/52/50df9120-7039-4456-a60f-7545a0b3a24c/7944dd02-d5af-4e08-a964-f5736ad0d13c.jpg","address_1":"Rodovia Rio-Santos LT J-1 LT J -

It is an institutional resource providing many facilities for individuals, students, profit and no profit association","description":"MUSE Fablab, a cultural soul  \r\n\r\nFabLab, inside the MUSE, was established in 2013, as part of an unprecedented museological journey at the new Science Museum of Trento that follows social and technological evolution from prehistoric times until today, with a view to technology as an applicable extension of human thought and a potential tool for tackling the challenges of the 21st century. \r\nFabLab is a place where ideas take shape: there are tools and skills for putting into practice those small or major innovations that can emerge in each of us. At FabLab, there are 3D printers, laser cutting and engraving machines, tools for electronics, programming, 3D drawing and also a classroom where students and adults can learn.\r\n\r\nThe cultural element is therefore the underlying theme that links all the activities offered and amplifies their meaning.\r\nEconomic sustainability is important but, of course, success is not made of economic balance alone.\r\nWe know our strengths: we are able to invent new proposals (sometimes new methods) that will allow our public to learn, be intrigued and have fun.\r\nOur way of educating, communicating and engaging new audiences in the use of digital technologies (adult-child couples, seniors, primary school children, university students) is basically our manifesto.\r\n\r\nThe mainstay of our Fablab lies in education and in technological literacy.\r\nWe constructed and developed most of the activities around this pillar, with the participation of numerous schoolteachers in our refresher courses, the progressive increase in memberships and a precious increase in female attendance.  \r\nWorking with common sense, enthusiasm and the desire to build something to believe in, has repaid us, in terms of presence, beyond all expectations.\r\n\r\nThe second and equally important mainstay is the social one.\r\nSo far we have carried out a service to citizens that has materialized in providing help to all those with an idea or a project and allowing them to fulfil it here with us: university students who have made prototypes for their thesis, young people about to create a start-up business or even simple model-makers or aspiring inventors who came here to give a shape to their ideas. \r\n\r\nThe challenge we now want to undertake is to give a broader social meaning through the development of projects in favour of vulnerable social categories. The construction of a FabLab capable of involving both people with physical or cognitive disabilities, as well as youths risking educational poverty. \r\n\r\nLastly, Fablab is also working towards another goal, which we had been chasing until now, and that we cannot achieve on our own: that of Open Innovation.  We realised that this cannot be a mainstay of the Fablab MUSE.  We are not a space where small businesses in the territory can create/produce innovation at full capacity. On the contrary: we can act as collectors and catalysts; we can co-organize excellent Open Innovation events for ad hoc projects - together with the other local partners.\r\nIn this sense, we can use these events to make collaborations increasingly solid, thus creating a network, and direct companies towards Industry 4.0 technologies. It is the goal towards which the European FabLabNet project has committed itself, trying to understand which directions to take. We can therefore help small start-ups businesses to obtain more visibility, but we can only help make their product materialize if we involve external partners. In fact, if a small company needs to produce something that will be placed on the market, it is no longer us in the role of interlocutors, but other local entities. We can arrange dialogue between individuals and facilitate scouting, contact and mutual acquaintance.  We are a place in which museum culture communicates with citizens, technology and business and, in this way, tries to innovate.\r\n\r\nOpening hours: \r\nTuesday till Friday: 10:00 am until 18 pm \r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"musefablab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/11/49/3cdc7153-48f8-40bb-bb67-76f9be3c54fd/MUSE Fablab.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/13/47/51/ffd8db7c-bf0d-4156-8d45-457545c450cf/MUSE Fablab.jpg","address_1":"Corso del Lavoro e della Scienza 3","address_2":"","city":"Trento","county":"Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol","postal_code":"38122","country_code":"IT","latitude":46.0625724,"longitude":11.1146080999999,"address_notes":"The lab is at the first floor of the Science Museum.

SAL was created thanks to funding from CONACYT and IPN. SAL's purpose is to support innovation, research and technology development.  Our approach is to open up our spaces aiming to create a learning community of makers. We think that open communication between maker enthusiasts will foster the development of our community to solve the local problems while at the same time our global integration with other similar communities will improve our skills, allowing us to share what we learn. Our objective in joining the FABLAB international community is to learn best practices to reduce the learning curve to achieve our goal.\r\n\r\nRaul Rojas Gonzalez is a Mexican scientist whose achievements in technical terms and the social impact of his academic activities inspire us to perform at our highest possible level.\r\n\r\nTo have developed SAL thanks to public financial support.

Visitors are expected to contribute something to the lab. It works as follows: On arrival each visitor pays € 50 in cash. Visitors who share their designs or their knowledge and skills can get the money refunded on departure. Sharing can be done for example by writing a FabPublication. Visitors who don't want to contribute (due to time constraints or other reasons) can contribute financially.

Based on the development and implementation of new cooperation models, new strategies for targeted cooperation of the relevant key players are researched and derived. This hotspot for innovation regularly hosts various programs such as makerthons, innovation weeks, training programs and much more.\r\nThe new Schumpeter Laboratory for Innovation offers opportunities to teach practical skills and applying them creatively. Therefore, it encourages students to freely invent and prototype as in the course “Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping”. By providing access to powerful tools of production within shared spaces and actively connecting the individuals involved, a significant boost in their commitment can be expected. Hands-on training concepts with learning by doing experiences represent an alternative to traditional teaching methods.\r\nThe construction work for the additional floor at Inffeldgasse 11 started in July 2017.

The VW eLabs are carrying that forward.\r\n\r\nSo, imagine identifying a problem. Now imagine having the tools, materials and community members at hand, in a designated space and culture, that can help bridge the gap that often exists between classroom theory and real-world practice. \r\n\r\nA VW eLab is a designated space in the school where we can all come to put classroom learning into applied practice. We have all kinds of cool tools that students and teachers can come use to prototype and revise solutions toward a goal.\r\n\r\nNot only do teachers have an opportunity to demonstrate what they know, they also learn alongside students about the things they don’t. Because no one can know it all. After all, the kind of problems students will face we haven’t even thought about, yet. In the VW eLab, everyone is demonstrating the concept of lifelong learning\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve never experienced it, working in a lab on longer-term projects offers opportunities for more informal discussion and relationships. The whole scene is pretty inspiring, uplifting, empowering.\r\n\r\nBroad VW eLab Guidelines:\r\n    Do no harm.\r\n    ABC: Always Be Cleaning, develop a \"clean as you go attitude.\"\r\n    It's okay if you don't know, ASK!\r\n\r\n\"...It’s crucial to have a setup, so that, at any given moment, when you get an idea, you have the place and the tools to make it happen.  \r\nWhen you don’t have a setup, there are many times when you get the inspiration, the idea, but you have no tools, no place to put it together. And the idea just sits there and festers. Over time, it will go away. You didn’t fulfill it--and that’s just a heartache.\"-David Lynch\r\n\r\nHaving a workspace, or as David Lynch calls it, “a setup,” allows us the opportunity to bring abstract concepts into concrete reality.\r\n\r\nThe Lab is scheduled independently from the Master Schedule, so that it may be utilized by either campus. That schedule is facilitated by the VW eLab Specialist and The Hub Media Specialist through Google Calendar, Form, or email/in-person follow-up. Teachers/Collaborators are contacted to help facilitate the Lab’s use as it relates to their “Student Engagement Module” (SEM). Working with the Specialists, teachers don’t have to worry so much about knowing exactly how everything will work in order to implement their idea, SEM, PBL or SOLE. Together, we work through planning and facilitating the work students will do to demonstrate and deepen their learning.\r\n\r\nThe VW eLab Specialist actively recruits classrooms and students to use the facility, as it pertains to applied learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nWith its place in the Community School, the VW eLab at Red Bank is also being used by those visitors, Monday through Thursday, with programming and times varying according to interest. For instance, many students are interested in skateboarding as a pastime. Using the tooling in the Lab, resourceful students may prototype modular components to a pop-up skate park.","slug":"vwelabatredbank","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/11/12/14/38/46/61969d5d-d81f-4a2f-80e2-0839536fdcf3/VW eLab logo.jpeg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/11/14/17/05/56/e84cf132-72e3-43ee-8cc5-4e44c07310e1/20181112_084740.jpg","address_1":"640 Morrison Springs Rd","address_2":"","city":"Chattanooga","county":"","postal_code":"37415","country_code":"US","latitude":35.1222129,"longitude":-85.3057402,"address_notes":"Turn left at the dumpsters and watch for the VW logo on the door to the left.","phone":"4238721900 ext 65042","email":"craig_matthew@hcde.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser","vinyl_cutting"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":6403,"url":"https://sites.google.com/hcde.org/dobetterworkbook/rbhs-vw-elab"}]},{"id":2117,"name":"SLU-DTI FabLab","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":2068,"blurb":"The SLU-DTI FabLab caters to micro, small, and medium enterprises, science and technology students, and enthusiasts in Baguio City and North Luzon in the Philippines.","description":"The FabLab's objective is primarily to provide technical support and services to MSMEs in order to improve their products and pave the way to their migration to Industry 4.0.

Il a pour ambition de permettre à tous l'accès à des outils numériques.","description":"Suite à sa création en mars 2015, l'association pour la culture numérique et l'environnement s'est donné pour mission première la création d'un lieu ouvert et accessible à tous qui permet de faire un lien entre le numérique et les nouvelles technologies et la rencontre et l'apprentissage. Au fil de ses rencontres avec des FabLabs comme Artilect à Toulouse, ainsi que lors de son implication au FabLab Festival, l'association a eu la volonté de monter un FabLab dans la ville d'Albi. Les mois qui ont suivi ont privilégié la rencontre avec de nombreuses personnes intéressées qui se sont impliquées au fur et à mesure et ont constitué la première communauté du futur FabLab.\r\n\r\nAprès plusieurs mois de travail et de réflexion, de soutiens comme celui de la Fondation Orange et de participation à de nombreux événements, l'association a pu installer le lab au sein du parc technopolitain de la ville d'Albi en octobre 2015, avec le soutien des élus locaux. C'est dans un petit local d'une quarantaine de mètres carrés que la communauté du FabLab a commencé à s'équiper d'outils, à accueillir le public de divers horizons et à diffuser l'esprit du lieu sur le territoire. À la suite de son installation, ACNE a lancé une campagne de financement participatif avec pour objectif d'acquérir une découpeuse laser et indirectement de donner une assise au projet. Le FabLab, lors de l'assemblée générale d'ACNE en mars 2016, a été renommé Albilab.\r\n\r\nAinsi, depuis son installation, l'association compte plus de 170 membres qui ont accès aux machines du FabLab et sont formés gratuitement pour pouvoir les utiliser. Plusieurs projets ont vu le jour et sont en réalisation au FabLab. Par exemple, nous accueillons depuis fin octobre un projet d'orthèse, d'une personne n'ayant pas réussi à trouver un modèle qui lui convienne depuis son accident il y a une quinzaine d'année. Ce projet a réuni une dizaine de personnes qui se regroupent au FabLab toutes les deux semaines pour travailler ensemble. L'équipe inclut des personnes venant d'horizons différents, allant du génie mécanique à l'ergothérapeute, en passant par le retraité passionné de nouvelles technologies. Ils reçoivent le soutien et les conseils des membres actifs du lieu. Depuis le mois d'avril un premier prototype a vu le jour. D'autres projets sont réalisés au FabLab, comme un projet de déco/architecture, un projet autour des jeux vidéos, un projet drones, etc. Chaque projet s'organise comme il le souhaite en fonction de son équipe et des disponibilités du FabLab.\r\n\r\nAvec l'aide de partenaires comme la Fondation Orange et l'association technopolitaine Albi-Innoprod, ainsi que grâce à la réussite de sa campagne de financement participatif, le FabLab a pu s'équiper de différents outils. Actuellement, les outils disponibles sont :\r\n- trois imprimantes 3D\r\n- une fraiseuse numérique\r\n- 2 découpeuses laser\r\n- une imprimante/découpeuse vinyle\r\n- une découpeuse vinyle\r\n- une brodeuse numérique\r\n- des cartes Arduino\r\n- des cartes Thingz\r\n- un scanner 3D\r\n- une extrudeuse\r\n- des outils divers apportés par la communauté : machine à coudre, outils de bricolage, perceuse à colonne...\r\n\r\nAfin de pouvoir rendre le projet pérenne et égalitaire, l'association a mis en place un mode de fonctionnement, en prenant exemple dans les autres FabLabs. Des cartes prépayées ont été crées afin de faciliter l'utilisation des outils (\"cartes spots\"). Seuls le matériau et l'utilisation des principales machines à commande numérique (imprimante 3D, découpeuse laser, fraiseuse numérique, découpeuse vinyle) sont payants. Le FabLab accueille tout type de projets dans le but de ne pas restreindre l'accès au lieu et les possibilités de création.\r\nL'association organise une fois par mois des initiations sur les outils. Elle a également une programmation destinée à permettre à plus de monde de s'approprier le lieu : ateliers DIY (bijoux, cuisine, robotique, produits ménagers, etc.), soirées projets, événements extérieurs... Elle travaille, à travers ses actions, sur la rencontre et le travail en réseau avec les acteurs locaux.","slug":"albilab","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/11/30/02/3f2a5673-670a-4264-8acd-e433dd8bcc4a/Albilab.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/28/14/50/14/d852ff57-8da2-4870-be6a-71d309f44955/Albilab.jpg","address_1":"8 Avenue Pierre-Gilles de Gennes","address_2":"","city":"Albi","county":"","postal_code":"81000","country_code":"FR","latitude":43.920103,"longitude":2.18144499999994,"address_notes":"Pour accéder au FabLab, il faut se diriger vers le parking d'Innoprod, derrière le bâtiment.

The ideaLab continues to inspire us all as an area where we discover ourselves, work together, make mistakes, try again, and learn.\r\n\r\nThe lab continues to grow and change every year as the interest and ideas of the students change to ensure that all students can make the projects they are passionate about. The ideaLab continues to evolve as a dynamic living and learning space, as illustrated by the diversifying additions of the Lab Fabrication. \r\nIdeaLab consists of four parts: Electronics and programming room, mechanical workshop, fabrication room and Multimedia Lab. In the electronics and programming lab we’ve, 2 Mac Pros and a PC for high power application like 3D Modeling, Ai training and video editing,  a soldering iron station, electronic tools for rapid prototyping, 3D printers and storage for most of the components we use in the lab. In the mechanical workshop, which is called the Bumper Lab, we build the mechanical parts for our projects and prototypes using various power and hand tools. In our fabrication room we have our CNC router and laser cutter. This room is in a separate building since we have a lot of young students coming into the lab. By placing the machines into a different room we aimed to prevent any injuries. The Multimedia Lab is the place where the students focused on entrepreneurship, graphic design and video production can work on their projects. There is a vinyl cutter which is used to make things like t-shirts and stickers from the designs the students create. Every room has an embedded smart TV system. \r\n\r\nIn IdeaLab, we are working on a number of interesting, garage-type STEAM projects, including arcade machines and games, drones, face and emotion recognition devices, sensors for IOT, and various RaspberryP iand Arduino projects. At the same time, we participate in many national and international projects, conferences and hackathons on a regular basis.  Since 2014, we have been organizing Hisar Coding Summit, a 2-day event where we give various free programming and design workshops to anyone who is willing to learn. In 2019 and 2020, we brought the Pi Wars robotics Competition to Turkey. In addition to the 2 day long Competition, we also gave electronics, programming, and design courses on how to build a Pi Wars robot to the competing teams. With the positive feedback we received from over 300 participants from the events we organized, we decided to give a workshop at FabXLive 2020 about building a modular competition robot for beginners. \r\n\r\nWe have been working on an educational toy robot named Pomelo, which teaches the basics of programming and computational thinking to younger kids with physical code blocks. We participated in several conferences including FabLearn Asia’20 with our prototypes and got our paper published by the IEEE. Currently, we are working on patenting this project. We have been collaborating with a professor in Wesley University for a research project about the transition from block-based coding to syntax-based coding. \r\nThe safety of the students in the lab is crucial. Therefore, we host “Safety Workshops” every year for the new students. The safety posters around the lab always reminds the students how to use the tools and machines correctly. \r\nStudents that work in the IdeaLab learn to take responsibility for their own learning and obtain skills like programming, 3D Design and critical thinking as they work according to our motto “Make, Fail, Learn and Repeat”.\r\n","slug":"idealabhisar","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/11/27/18/56/44/5ed6f011-7512-4f64-80b5-19bafee541d2/Screen Shot 2020-11-27 at 21.52.36.png","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/08/09/19/22/24/f876f18d-85c0-4b5c-850b-e28022af05f1/idealab2.jpg","address_1":"Göktürk Merkez, İstanbul Cd.

FabLab Coventry’s mission is to explore a new relationship between the university and the City through the co-design and implementation of a civic engagement programme that provides mutual benefit to citizens, students, researchers, business, policy makers and NGO’s in Coventry and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe programme is delivered through FabLab Coventry and its Eco Furniture Factory. These two community maker spaces provide a neutral environment for all communities to come together to socialise, research, create, make, trade and or gain new skills and qualifications. \r\n\r\nFabLab Coventry connects students, researchers, local communities and business together in responding to social challenges through mutually beneficial learning and social innovation, resulting in qualifications, publications, artwork, citizen science and policy innovation. \r\nHistory\r\nOne consequence of the University’s growth and success has been a changing relationship with the City; we are still close, but for some parts of our work, daily life on campus has become disconnected from the wider city; the University sought to change this trend.\r\n\r\nCTPSR engaged with over 3,000 local residents and community organisations in co-designing an innovative civic engagement initiative, resulting in the establishment of FabLab Coventry in 2016.\r\n\r\nThe FabLab - short for fabrication laboratory - is a community maker space, providing access to state-of-the-art computer-controlled tools like 3D printers, CNC and laser cutters as well as traditional metal, woodworking and sewing tools. It is open access and many users are simply looking to gain new skills - or share theirs; this is supported by an offer of 48 different UK accredited courses and qualifications.\r\nTechnicians and researchers are on hand to support with the tools, skills and technology to be able to make almost anything, engage in social research or start new enterprises. They run classes and support learning on the equipment.\r\n\r\nFabLab Goals\r\n1.\tTo unlock the resources in the University’s staff, students and infrastructure to strengthen civic contribution\r\n2.\tThrough citizen social science and social innovation projects which address societal challenges, aligning CTPSR Sustainable Development Goals research with the lived experience of local communities\r\n3.\tTo support local communities to acquire skills, gain qualifications and deliver social innovation projects alongside university staff and students\r\n4.\tTo support a circular economy in the city by bringing education, business and research together within the Eco Furniture Factory\r\n5.\tTo support over 4,000 students and local citizens between 2016 and 2023 to gain qualifications in digital making, upcycling and research skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabLabCoventry Eco Furniture Factory\r\nIn recognition of the need to live more sustainable lives, FabLabCoventry has set up a second facility, aimed at supporting people to gain skills and inspiration from giving old materials, and waste a second, third or fourth life by transforming them into new products. \r\n\r\nIn line with the FabLab ethos, the Eco furniture factory helps us to further grow the Coventry maker community by providing individuals with the opportunity to meet and work on projects with new people, to learn new skills, gain qualifications or start up an Eco-enterprise.

It visited public schools in 13 locations in 5 departments of the country (Alto Paraná, Central, Cordillera, Caaguazú, President Hayes) with digital fabrication introduction workshops that benefited more than 1000 students. In these workshops, of 16 hours each, the facilitators of the FAB LAB Paraguay Educa advise students in the realization of integrated projects where they learn about 3D design, basic electronics, programming and the use of various tools that allow you to carry almost any idea to a prototype.\r\nSeeking the sustainability of the project, the FAB LAB Paraguay Educa offers services of workshops and courses of digital manufacturing and maker culture to private schools and universities, in addition to machine rental services and training in the use of equipment for teachers, companies and organizations.\r\n","slug":"fablabparaguayeduca","avatar_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/10/08/18/26/57/e3de85bb-591f-4b52-8c33-5842d63b0410/logo jpeg 1.jpg","header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/10/08/18/26/57/7c86c337-2cd4-44d0-b8e6-7041b7b0f4a6/header fab lab.jpg","address_1":"Mariscal López 1750 casi Kubitschek","address_2":"","city":"Asunción","county":"Central","postal_code":"1209","country_code":"PY","latitude":-25.2929819433878,"longitude":-57.6043264705139,"address_notes":"","phone":"+595 971 601 235","email":"fablab@paraguayeduca.org","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","circuit_production","laser","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[]},{"id":1346,"name":"FabLab Bucharest","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"We are very excited about sharing our passion with as much people as possible and allowing them to share theirs with us. Our three rooms and big yard are packed with tools for you to tinker with :)","description":"At heart, we at FabLabBucharest are model makers. The lab started with architecture students making models for their university projects and it grew into something bigger. \r\nI will try to explain to the best of my abilities who we are, how we work and what drives us.\r\n\r\nWhat drives us:\r\nBeing a group of makers ourselves, always dissembling things and fascinated with how they work, the idea of having a place where people can just build the things that they are passionate about and learn about new technologies and techniques was very appealing.\r\nBut the maker movement has been slow in Romania, due to a number of reasons: there is still a small market for locally manufactured goods which always turn out more expensive then wide scalled produced goods. \"Making\" as a hobby is often expensive and there is no widespread culture for that yet, but there is a curiosity and desire for it.\r\nWe want to allow people to get a taste for understanding how things are made and to try to make things themselves.\r\nHaving no formal training, we educated ourselves with the help of online tutorials and forums. With the help of these communities we learned how to make molds and cast resin, how to paint and how to use different equipment. We are very atached to this comunity and want to give something back.\r\nWe believe in a future where people are more curious and have an understanding of how technology works, how accesible it can be and how they can use it to express themselves.\r\n\r\nWho we are:\r\nThe team is composed of six people the majority with a background in architecture, each assigned a type of machine to operate but all tinkerers. We reside in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Our workshop is in an old style Romanian house near the center of the city. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow we work:\r\nWe mainly offer services for 3D printing, laser cutting and cnc milling; we help design and do projects for firms and individuals; that is how we are able to pay for equipment, rent and salaries. At the moment we are a type C  FabLab, we do not have the space necessary to have many people working for different projects at one time. We try to encourage young entrepreneurs and artists by letting them use our facilities to make their designs either by themselves or with our help. As a solution to our temporary space problem,  most presentations and courses regarding \"making\" in general and 3D printing especially, are held outside our lab, in schools, in universities and at different events. \r\nWe also hold Open Days, where we invite people to spend a day (Saturday usually) with us and build something. \r\nOn our facebook page you can see pictures from some of these events.\r\n\r\nIn schools, we bring our 3D printers and teach children ages 14-18 how to use basic modeling software and how 3D printing works. We work with another NGO from Romania, a classroom is no bigger than 15 children.\r\n\r\nAt events, such as TEDxBucharest or other such events, we have talked about the concept of a FabLab and tried different experiments, either with 3D printers or with other games. On our Youtube page you can see a stop motion we made at the event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMh1S3-jYNo\r\n\r\nAmong the FabLabs we have seen and interacted with are: FabLab Vienna (the Happy Lab), FabLab Nuremberg, FabLab Budapest, FabLab Sofia. We were also Ambasadors at MakerFair Rome 2016, having participated in European Maker Week 2016 with two events.\r\n\r\nFor more information or if you have any questions at all, contact me at ina@fablab.ro \r\n","slug":"fablabbucharest","avatar_url":null,"header_url":"http://fablabs.io.s3.amazonaws.com/2017/01/30/12/19/41/cab9951f-7f19-4d00-9e27-cfb3d2986cbe/_MG_2231.jpg","address_1":"Theodor Pallady 57","address_2":"","city":"București","county":"Bucuresti","postal_code":"032266","country_code":"RO","latitude":44.4069238260011,"longitude":26.204997769867,"address_notes":"It's a warehouse P+1, grey with blue, near Ikea Store","phone":"+40724265166","email":"contact@fablab.ro","capabilities":["three_d_printing","cnc_milling","laser","precision_milling"],"activity_status":"active","links":[{"id":2393,"url":"http://www.fablab.ro"},{"id":2394,"url":"http://www.fb.com/fablab.ro"},{"id":2395,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZvbXxBSCMHVqE9bC9Bzpg"}]},{"id":952,"name":"Fab Lab Hornafjordur","kind_name":"fab_lab","parent_id":null,"blurb":"Fab Lab Hornafjordur is located in the South-East of Icland.
